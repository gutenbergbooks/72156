<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>The</span> account of the several journeys through England
undertaken by my kinswoman, Celia Fiennes, in the reign
of William and Mary, may prove interesting, as shewing the
manners and customs of those times. The writer’s diligent
and attentive observation of details concerning the various
counties through which she passed, either on horseback or in
her equipage, and her descriptions of the many gentlemen’s
seats visited by her, seem worthy of notice and preservation.
Numerous towns are described, and a great many churches
and country seats—some of which doubtless no longer
exist—are minutely detailed. There being little literature
of this kind and period in existence, Celia Fiennes’s diary
almost takes the position and value of an historical document.
The portion relating to London is interesting. The
Lord Mayor’s Show and other ceremonies are fully
described. The perusal of these quaint and straight-forward
pages, in which there is little pretence to style,
gives a good idea of what England was two hundred
years back. The only actual date mentioned is 1695.
The absence of roads strikes one, and also the unimportance
of what are now the great manufacturing districts of
the north. Bristol appears to have been the second city
in the kingdom. The fashionable baths and spas and
style of bathing are minutely described. With the exception
of the dome, St Paul’s Cathedral was finished, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Whitehall Palace had recently been burned—the authoress
suspects by Papist incendiaries.</p>
<p class='c012'>The original MS., given to me by my father, has been
copied verbatim, as I believe any correction or alteration
would spoil its quaint originality. Celia Fiennes was
daughter of Colonel Nathaniel Fiennes, a Parliamentarian
Officer, by his marriage with Miss Whitehead, and was
sister of the third Viscount Saye and Sele.</p>

  <h2 class='c018'>TO THE READER.</h2>
</div>

<hr class='c019' />

<p class='c020'><span class='sc'>As</span> this was never designed: soe not likely to fall into
the hands of any but my near relations, there needs not
much to be said to Excuse or recommend it. Something
may be diverting and proffitable tho’ not to Gentlemen that
have travelled more about England, staid longer in places,
might have more acquaintance and more opportunity
to be inform’d. My Journeys as they were begun to regain
my health by variety and change of aire and exercise, soe
whatever promoted that was pursued; and those informations
of things as could be obtein’d from jnns en passant,
or from some acquaintance, inhabitants of such places could
ffurnish me with for my diversion, I thought necessary to
remark: that as my bodily health was promoted my mind
should not appear totally unoccupied, and the collecting it
together remain for my after conversation (with such as
might be inquisitive after such and such places) to w<sup>ch</sup> might
have recourse; and as most I converse with knows both the
ffreedom and Easyness I speak and write as well as my
deffect in all, so they will not expect exactness or politeness
in this book, tho’ such Embellishments might have
adorned the descriptions and suited the nicer taste.</p>
<p class='c012'>Now thus much without vanity may be asserted of the
subject, that if all persons, both Ladies, much more Gentlemen,
would spend some of their tyme in Journeys to visit
their native Land, and be curious to Inform themselves and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>make observations of the pleasant prospects, good buildings,
different produces and manufactures of each place, with
the variety of sports and recreations they are adapt to,
would be a souveraign remedy to cure or preserve ffrom
these Epidemick diseases of vapours, should I add Laziness?—it
would also fform such an Idea of England, add
much to its Glory and Esteem in our minds and cure the
evil Itch of overvalueing fforeign parts; at least ffurnish
them with an Equivalent to entertain strangers when
amongst us, Or jnform them when abroad of their native
Country, which has been often a Reproach to the English,
ignorance and being strangers to themselves. Nay the
Ladies might have matter not unworthy their observation,
soe subject for conversation, within their own compass in
each county to which they relate, and thence studdy now
to be serviceable to their neighbours especially the poor
among whome they dwell, which would spare them the
uneasye thoughts how to pass away tedious dayes, and
tyme would not be a burthen when not at a card or dice
table, and the ffashions and manners of fforeign parts less
minded or desired. But much more requisite is it for
Gentlemen in g<sup>l</sup> service of their country at home or abroad,
in town or country, Especially those that serve in parliament
to know and jnform themselves y<sup>e</sup> nature of Land,
y<sup>e</sup> Genius of the Inhabitants, so as to promote and improve
Manufacture and trade suitable to each and encourage all
projects tending thereto, putting in practice all Laws made
for each particular good, maintaining their priviledges,
procuring more as requisite; but to their shame it must be
own’d many if not most are Jgnorant of anything but the
name of the place for which they serve in parliament; how
then can they speake for or promote their good or Redress
their Grievances? But now I may be justly blamed
to pretend to give acc: of our Constitution, Customs,
Laws, Lect, matters farre above my Reach or capacity, but
herein I have described what have come within my knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>either by view and reading, or relation from others which
according to my conception have faithfully Rehearsed, but
where I have mistaken in any form or subject matter I easily
submitt to a correction and will enter such Erratas in a
supplement annext to y<sup>e</sup> Book of some particulars since
remark’d; and shall conclude with a hearty wish and
recommendation to all, but Especially my own Sex, the
studdy of those things which tends to Improve the mind
and makes our Lives pleasant and comfortable as well as
proffitable in all the Stages and Stations of our Lives, and
render suffering and age supportable and Death less fformidable
and a future State more happy.</p>

    <div><i>THE ACCOUNT OFF</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>severall Journeys into severall parts of England with many
Remarkes; some w<sup>th</sup> my mother from Newtontony Wiltshire
which is all on the downs a fine Champion Country
pleasant for all sports, Rideing, Hunting, Courseing, Setting
and shooteing. From Newtontony I went to Sarum 8 miles
which is a Citty and Bishop’s Seat, pretty Large town
Streetes broad but through y<sup>e</sup> midst of them runs a little
rivulet of water which makes y<sup>e</sup> Streetes not so clean or so
easye to pass in, they have stepps to Cross it and many
open places for horses and Carriages to Cross itt—itt takes
off Much from the beauty of y<sup>e</sup> streetes—the Cause of it
was from the burning of the old town called Salsebury
which was on a hill about a mile off this and it was so drye
and farre from springs that it was destroyed by fire and only
the ruines of the Castle is to be seen like a high wall with
fortifications: this town now Stands low by the water by a
great River, the houses are old Mostly timber Buildings,
there is a large Market House with the town hall over it
and a prison Just by—there is also a large Cross in another
place and house over it for a Constant Market for fruite,
fowle, Butter and Cheese and a fish Market; the town is
well served with all provissions; there is good buildings in
that part they call the Close, both New built and y<sup>e</sup> old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>good houses belonging to the doctors of the Church. Y<sup>e</sup>
Dean has a very good house and Gardens, so is the Bishop’s
Palace at y<sup>e</sup> end of a Row of trees—the roomes are lofty
and Stately: all these houses are round y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall which
is esteemed the finest in England in all respects, it only lyes
low in a watry meadow so y<sup>t</sup> the foundations is in the
water, made of ffaggots and timber, yet notwithstanding its
want of a Riseing ground to stand on y<sup>e</sup> steeple is seen
many miles off, the spire being so high it appeares to us
below as sharpe as a Dagger, Yet is in the Compass on the
top as bigg as a Cart wheele; its all stone and Carved finely
with spires and Arches, there are severall doores into y<sup>e</sup>
Church, in the body of it stands the pulpet and seates on
each side; there are two large Isle’s runnes up on either side;
the font stands below opposite to the quire y<sup>t</sup> enters w<sup>th</sup> 2
or 3 steps assent from a large Cross Isle that leades to the
Cloysters, in which is y<sup>e</sup> Chapter house which is very large
and supported only by one small stone Pillar in y<sup>e</sup> middle,
painted round the walls with figures Carved y<sup>e</sup> whole accō:
of the book of Genesis, the Windows are painted very
finely—Much of the History of the Bible. There is as
many little Chappels in the Church as months in a yeare,
as many doores as weekes, as many Marble pillars as dayes,
as many windows as houres, as many partitions in the
windows as minutes in the year. The roofe of the Church
is very lofty and exactly neate in all things though not so
large as some other Cathedralls—the top of the Qoire is
exactly painted and it lookes as fresh as if but new done
though of 300 yeares standing—there is a very good organ
and a deske for the reader raised so high even with the
organ for y<sup>e</sup> advantage of the voice to be heard, yet y<sup>e</sup>
Church is so lofty y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Eccos drowns y<sup>e</sup> Intelligableness of
the voice. The Comunion table, hangings and y<sup>e</sup> booses
are all of crimson velvet with gold fringe, 2 large Candlestickes
gilt w<sup>th</sup> great white tapers in them, a large gilt bason
to receive y<sup>e</sup> offerings in—there is many good monuments
there, also there are ye Statues of the 3 bishops that built
the Church cut in stone—there are two large fine monuments
above y<sup>e</sup> Rest—one all free stone for the lord George,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>his Effiges and ladyes att length on a bed in their Robes
and ruffs on pillows, and y<sup>e</sup> four pillars are twisted, and
over it Angels, figures of birds, beasts, flowers and leaves
very fine, there sits Justice w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> ballance in her hand, one
scale laying over y<sup>e</sup> other twisted lookes very natural and
well, with y<sup>e</sup> wreathed work all in free stone with their
Armes cut about in Escutheons all about it; the other is a
monument for the Duke of Summerset all in marble, a
large bed his Effigee in garment and ruff all in Coullours,
his lady the same only she is laid one step above him
because she was Daughter to the Dowager of ffrance and
sister to Henry y<sup>e</sup> 7<sup>th</sup> of England by her second husband
Charles brandon Duke of Suffolk.</p>
<p class='c012'>There is y<sup>e</sup> Effiges of their 2 sonnes, Lord Beachom at
their head and Lord Seymour at y<sup>e</sup> feete in Armour on their
Knees, and severall Daughters on their knees at y<sup>e</sup> bottom
and 12 pillars of Irish gray marble. The Armes is cutt finely
in Escutcheons &amp;c. and in figures with y<sup>e</sup> supporters and
severall sorts of beasts carved in a piramide fashion, and on
y<sup>e</sup> top the Duke’s Corronet—these 2 monum<sup>ts</sup> are railed in
with Iron grates, there is the Effigee in stone off a doctor
that starved himself to death attempting to imitate our
Saviour to fast 40 dayes—but at 31 dayes end he became
sensible of his evil and would have retrieved his life by
eateing againe, but then by y<sup>e</sup> Just judgment of god could not
swallow any thing down his throate;—there is a chaple or
burying place of Judge poppums that had two very wild
sonnes and by 2 pictures of his sonnes, pictured one with
death y<sup>e</sup> other with a skeleton and set in y<sup>e</sup> room they were
to come into by their father’s order, it pleased God to bless
as a meanes to reclaim them. Ye pictures are still there;
the windows of the Church but especially y<sup>e</sup> Quire are very
finely painted and large of y<sup>e</sup> history of y<sup>e</sup> bible—the tower
ffor y<sup>e</sup> bells are in y<sup>e</sup> yard at some distance from the Church—there
are 6 Churches in the town and subburbs and y<sup>e</sup>
County Goal at y<sup>e</sup> end of the town called ffisherton, just by
the great river that runnes to Christ-Church in Salsebury.
They keep the quarter session once in y<sup>e</sup> yeare the oth<sup>r</sup>
tymes are kept at Malbrough about 24 mile off and at y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Devises about y<sup>e</sup> same distance w<sup>ch</sup> is a very neate little
town with a very good market house and town hall sett on
stone pillars; it is a bourrough and a very rich tradeing
place ffor the Clothing trade, the fourth place y<sup>e</sup> session is
kept is Warminster about y<sup>e</sup> same distance—its a pretty
little town a good Market for corn and there is the Mindiffe
Coale which is allmost as good as the sea Coale from New-Castle
that is dugg out of the hills all about;—But y<sup>e</sup>
Assizes is allwayes kept at Salsebury and is a Major town
though Wilton about 2 mile off is y<sup>e</sup> County town and y<sup>e</sup>
Knights of y<sup>e</sup> shire are chosen there, though its now but as
a little village as it were, and only supported by the Earle
of Pembrooke which lives there and has a very ffine house
with large Courts one within another. At y<sup>e</sup> Entrance there
is a lofty Hall with good Pictures, 3 or 4 dineing roomes
and drawing roomes of State with very good bed Chambers
and well furnished velvet damaske and tissue, one Gallery
and y<sup>e</sup> dineing roome was all wanscoated with pictures of y<sup>e</sup>
family—there is a drawing roome and Anti roome, y<sup>e</sup>
wanscoate is painted with y<sup>e</sup> whole History of the Acadia
romance made by S<sup>r</sup> Philip Sidney, brother to the then
Countess of Pembrooke and Composed by him in y<sup>e</sup> ffine
woods above y<sup>e</sup> house.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another room is painted w<sup>th</sup> all sorts of sports, Hunting,
Hawking &amp;c.—they are all finely painted on the Ceiling and
very lofty. there is one dineing roome y<sup>t</sup> the Chimney is
just under a window and the Tunnells runnes upon each
side. there is one Chamber, the chimney stands Just by the
window opposite to Salsebury, and on the black Marble
Chimney piece soe finely polished you may see all the
Cathedrall as in a Glass; I have seen it plaine. There are
very fine Marble Chimney pieces in most of y<sup>e</sup> roomes, and
marble windows. The Gardens are very fine with many
gravel walkes with grass squaires set with fine brass and
stone statues—fish ponds and basons with ffigures in y<sup>e</sup>
middle spouting out water—dwarfe trees of all sorts and a
fine flower garden—much wall fruite. Y<sup>e</sup> river runns through
y<sup>e</sup> garden that easeily conveys by pipes water to all Parts.</p>

<p class='c012'>A Grottoe is att y<sup>e</sup> end of the garden just y<sup>e</sup> middle off y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>house—its garnished with many fine ffigures of y<sup>e</sup> Goddesses,
and about 2 yards off the doore is severall pipes in a
line that with a sluce spoutts water up to wett the strangers—in
the middle roome is a round table and a large Pipe in
the midst, on which they put a Crown or Gun or a branch,
and so y<sup>t</sup> spouts the water through y<sup>e</sup> Carvings and poynts
all round y<sup>e</sup> roome at y<sup>e</sup> Artists pleasure to wet y<sup>e</sup> Company—there
are figures at Each corner of y<sup>e</sup> roome that Can weep
water on the beholders and by a straight pipe on y<sup>e</sup> table
they force up y<sup>e</sup> water into y<sup>e</sup> hollow carving of y<sup>e</sup> rooff like
a Crown or Coronet to appearance but is hollow within to
retaine y<sup>e</sup> water fforced into it in great quantetyes y<sup>t</sup> disperses
in y<sup>e</sup> hollow Cavity over y<sup>e</sup> roome and descends in a
Shower of raine all about y<sup>e</sup> roome—on each side is two little
roomes which by the turning their wires y<sup>e</sup> water runnes in
y<sup>e</sup> rockes—you see and hear it and also it is so contrived in
one room y<sup>t</sup> it makes y<sup>e</sup> melody of Nightingerlls and all sorts
of birds w<sup>ch</sup> engages y<sup>e</sup> Curiosity of y<sup>e</sup> Strangers to go in to
see, but at y<sup>e</sup> Entrance off each room is a line of pipes that
appear not till by a Sluce moved—it washes y<sup>e</sup> spectators
designed for diversion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Y<sup>e</sup> Grottoe is leaded on y<sup>e</sup> top where are fish ponds, and
just without y<sup>e</sup> grottoe is a wooden bridge over y<sup>e</sup> river. Y<sup>e</sup>
barristers are set out w<sup>th</sup> Lyons set thick on Either Side w<sup>th</sup>
their mouths open, and by a sluce spout out water each to
other in a perfect arch y<sup>e</sup> length of y<sup>e</sup> bridge. There are
fine woods beyond y<sup>e</sup> house and a large parke walled in.
From thence I went to Blandford in Dorsetshire 18 miles
through a haire waring and a forest of y<sup>e</sup> Kings.</p>

<p class='c012'>Blandford is a pretty neate Country town. Thence to
Merly by Wimborn over a great river Called the Stoure and
a large Arched bridge to a Relations house, S<sup>r</sup> William Constantines
house—thence to Poole a little seaport town 4
miles off where was a very good Minister in y<sup>e</sup> publick
Church—M<sup>r</sup> Hardy.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence we went by boate to a little Isle Called
brownsea 3 or 4 leagues off where there is much
Copperice made, the stones being found about y<sup>e</sup> Isle in y<sup>e</sup>
shore in great quantetyes. there is only one house there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>w<sup>ch</sup> is the Governours, besides little fishermen’s houses;
they being all taken up about y<sup>e</sup> Copperice workes; they
gather y<sup>e</sup> Stones and place them on ground raised like y<sup>e</sup>
beds in gardens, rows one above the other and are all
Shelving, so y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> raine disolves y<sup>e</sup> Stones and it draines
down into trenches and pipes made to receive and Convey
it to y<sup>e</sup> house, y<sup>ch</sup> is fitted with Iron panns four square and
of a pretty depth at least 12 yards over. They place Iron
spikes in y<sup>e</sup> panns full of branches and so as y<sup>e</sup> Liquor
boyles to a candy it hangs on those branches; I saw some
taken up—it look’d like a vast bunch of grapes. Y<sup>e</sup> Coullour
of y<sup>e</sup> Copperace not being much differing it lookes cleare
like Suger-Candy—so when y<sup>e</sup> water is boyled to a Candy
they take it out and replenish the panns with more liquor. I
do not remember they added anything to it only y<sup>e</sup> Stones of
Copperice disolved by y<sup>e</sup> raine into liquor as I mention’d at
first—there are great furnaces under, y<sup>t</sup> Keepes all the panns
boyling—it was a large room or building with Severall of
these large panns: they do add old Iron and nailes to y<sup>e</sup>
Copperass Stones. This is a noted place for lobsters and
Crabs and shrimps. I there eate some very good. From
Merly we went to y<sup>e</sup> Isle of Purbeck. At Warrum we passed
over a bridge where y<sup>e</sup> sea flowed in, and Came by y<sup>e</sup> ruines
of Corffe Castle which stands on a hill, yet surrounded by
much higher hills y<sup>t</sup> might easily command it, and so in y<sup>e</sup>
Civil warrs was batter’d down with Granadeers—thence you
rise a great ascent of hills, called the Linch or rather y<sup>e</sup> ridge,
being so for 3 or 4 miles, rideing to Quare, which was
16 miles ffrom Merly to a relations house—Cos’n Colliers.</p>

<p class='c012'>From this ridge you see all y<sup>e</sup> Island over, which lookes
very fruitfull, good lands, Meadows, woods and jnclosures—there
are many quarys in these hills of y<sup>t</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> is called the
free stone from hence they digg it—the shores are very
Rocky all about y<sup>e</sup> Island. We went 3 miles off to Sonidge
a sea faire place not very big—there is a flatt sand by y<sup>e</sup>
sea a little way: they take up stones by y<sup>e</sup> shores y<sup>t</sup> are so
oyly, as y<sup>e</sup> poor burn it for ffire, and its so light a ffire it
Serves for Candle too, but it has a strong offensive smell.
At a place 4 mile off called Sea Cume the Rockes are so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Craggy and y<sup>e</sup> Creekes of land so many y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> sea is very
turbulent—I pick’d shells and it being a spring tide I saw
y<sup>e</sup> sea beat upon y<sup>e</sup> Rockes at least 20 yards with Such a
ffoame or ffroth—and at another place the rockes had so
large a Cavity and Hollow y<sup>t</sup> when y<sup>e</sup> Sea flowed in, it
runne almost round and Sounded like some hall or high
arch. In this Island are severall pretty good houses though
not very large. Att Kingston, S<sup>r</sup> William Muese has a
pretty house, and att Income M<sup>r</sup> Coliffords—Doonshay,
M<sup>r</sup> Dollings and 7 mile off Quare. Att Finnum, lady
Larences, there is a pretty large house but very old timber
built: there I eate y<sup>e</sup> best Lobsters and Crabs, being boyled
in y<sup>e</sup> Sea water and scarce Cold—very large and Sweet.
Most of the houses in y<sup>e</sup> Island are built of stone—this is
Just by the great Cliffts w<sup>ch</sup> are a vast height from y<sup>e</sup> sea—here
is plenty of provision of all sorts especially of fish.
ﬀrom Finnum we ascend a high hill of a great length till
you are out of y<sup>e</sup> Island which does hardly appeare to be
now an Isle, the tide having left it on this side that you
passe only a little Brooke. There is another Castle called
Brindon, but y<sup>t</sup> lyes low and appears not much—thence we
came to Piddle 6 or 7 miles off where was a relation—Mr
Oxenbridg; an old house w<sup>ch</sup> formerly was an abby—thence
to Dorchester town 5 miles—it stands on y<sup>e</sup> side of
a Hill the river runnes below it—the town lookes Compact
and the streetes are very neately pitch’d and of a good
breadth—The Market-place is spaceious—The Church very
handsome and full of galleries.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence we went to Burport about 8 miles—The wayes
are stony and very narrow—the town has a steep hill to
descend through the whole place—thence to Woolfe 4 miles
to a relation—Mr Newbery a man of many whymseys—would
keep no women servants—had all washing, Ironing
dairy and all performed by men—his house look’s like a
little village when you Come into y<sup>e</sup> Yard—so many little
buildings apart from each other—one for a stillitory—another
for out houses and offices, another long building for
Silk wormes, and y<sup>e</sup> dwelling house is but mean and spoyl’d
by his ffancy of makeing a hall up 3 storyes high and so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>lofty nothing suiteable to it. He had good gardens and
orchards much good ffruite, but all in a most rude Confused
manner. Thence we went to Colway neare Lime in
Somersetshire about 8 miles to a relations house Mr
Hendly’s—from thence it is 2 miles to Lime a seaport place
open to the main ocean, and so high and bleake Sea, that
to secure the Harbour for shipps they have been at a great
Charge to build a Mold from the town with stone like a halfe
Moon, w<sup>ch</sup> they call the Cobb; its raised with a high wall
and this runns into y<sup>e</sup> Sea a good Compass that y<sup>e</sup> Shipps
rides safely within it, when the tide is out we may see the
foundations of some part of it—that is the tyme they looke
over it to see any breach and repaire it immediately, else y<sup>e</sup>
tide come with so much violence would soone beate it down—there
is some part of it low and only is to joyne y<sup>e</sup> rest to
the land, and at high water is all Cover’d of such a depth of
water that shipps may pass over it to enter the Cobb or
halfe moone, which is difficult for fforeigners to attempt,
being ignorant, though its better than goeing round the other
way for those that know and do observe the tide—the spring
tides and any Storme does some tymes beate up and wash
over the walls of the forte or castle into the Court and so
runns into the town, though at other tymes when its’ the
ordinary tide and calme sea it is at least 300 yards from the
banke on which the high wall is built—In most parts of
somersetshire it is very fruitfull for Orchards, plenty of
apples and peares, but they are not Curious in the Planting
the best sort of fruite which is a great pitty, being so soone
produced and such quantetyes, they are likewise as Careless
when they make Cider—they press all sorts of Apples
together, else they might have as good sider as in any other
parts, even as good as the Herrifordshire—they make
great quantetyes of Cider, their presses are very large, so as I
have seen a Cheese as they call them which yeilded 2 hoddsheads—they
pound their apples, then lay fresh straw on the
press, and on that a good lay off Pulp of the apples, then
turne in the ends of the straw over it all round and lay fresh
straw, then more apples up to the top. Just by Lime you
Cross a little brooke into Devonshire which is much like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>Somersetshire—fruitfull Country’s for Corn, graseing, much
for inclosures that makes the wayes very narrow, so as in
some places a Coach and Waggons Cannot pass—they are
forced to Carry their Corn and Carriages on horses’ backes
with frames of wood like pannyers on either side y<sup>e</sup> horse,
so load it high and tye it w<sup>th</sup> Cords—this they do altogether
the farther Westward they goe for y<sup>e</sup> wayes grow narrower
and narrower on to y<sup>e</sup> lands end. They shewed me the
Lizard point from Lime, it was a good distance—Y<sup>e</sup> land
grows narrower in a compass round, as it were round the
sea. From lime the wayes are also difficult by reason of the
very steep hill up and down, and that so successively as
little or no plaine even ground, and full of large smooth
pebbles that make the strange horses slip and uneasye to go—the
horses of the Country are accustomed to it and travell
well in the rodes—in y<sup>e</sup> opener wayes they use a sort of
waine or carriage made narrower than our Southern
Waggon, but longer and so load them high—from Lime to
Burport is 12 miles and so to Dorchester; thence to Blandford
we pass over Woodbery hill eminent for a great Faire
that is kept there of all things: the road passed by Cherbery—the
foot of the hill on the Slope stands a pretty Seate
of Mr Earles my relation—the house is new built on y<sup>e</sup> brow
of y<sup>e</sup> hill whence you have large prospects of 20 mile round—you
may see Shaftesbury thence 16 mile off—there is a
good wood behind the house, good gardens wall’d with
plenty of fruit, good fish and decoy pounds. There is a very
good Hall at the entrance leads you to a large parlour and
drawing room on y<sup>e</sup> right hand that opens to the gardens—a
very good little parlour on the left with servants room,
and another parlour for smoakeing, all well wanscoated and
painted and the offices convenient—the Chambers are good
and lofty and sizeable—good ffurniture in the best 2
Chambers, in an angle the staires leads up halfe way into
y<sup>e</sup> middle of the house and so divides in four parts and
runnes to each angle.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence 6 miles to Blandford, thence 18 to Salsebury and
8 mile to Newtontony which stands in y<sup>e</sup> midst of y<sup>e</sup> downs
8 mile from Andover a market town in Hampshire and y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>roade to London. It lyes 15 mile from Winchester—it is
three mile from Amesbury and 2 mile more to Stoneage
that stands on Salsebury plaine—eminent for many battles
being faught there—this Stoneage is reckon’d one of the
wonders of England how such prodigeous stone should be
brought there, as no such Stone is seen in y<sup>e</sup> Country nearer
than 20 mile. They are placed on the side of a hill in a
rude jregullar form—two stones stands up and one laid on
their tops with morteses into each other and thus are
severall in a round like a wall with spaces between, but
some are fallen down, so spoyle the order or breach in the
temple, as some think it was in the heathen tymes; others
thinke it the Trophy of some victory wone by one
Ambrosious, and thence the town by it has its name of
Amesbury. There is severall rows of lesser stones within
the others set up in the same forme of 2 upright and one
lies on the top like a gateway. How they were brought
thither or whether they are a made stone is not resolved—they
are very hard yet I have seen some of them scraped—the
weather seemes not to penetrate them. To increase
the wonder of the story is that none Can Count them twice
alike—they stand confused and some single stones at a
distance but I have told them often, and bring their
number to 91. This Country is most Champion and open,
pleasant for recreations—its husbandry is mostly Corn and
sheep, the Downs though short grass y<sup>e</sup> feed is sweet, producing
the finest wooll and sweet meat though but small.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little towns or villages lies in the valleys and runs
along in the bottom and are called Bourns having water
running in most of them. From Stonidge I went to Evell
in Somersetshire, thence to Meer a little town about 15
mile; by the town is a vast high hill called the Castle of
Meer—its now all grass over and so steepe up that the
ascent is by footsteps cut in the side of the hill. I was on
the top where some had been digging and was come to a
space that was Arched and the walls plaistred and washed
white and smooth—it was but a little roome, I tooke a
piece of its walls and plaister. That shews there may be
Cells or vaults in the hill—from thence to Wincauton 7
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>miles which is on a steep hill and very stoney—you go
through the town all the way down as it were a steep
precipice, all Rocks—thence to Castle Cary 3 or 4 miles—its
generally a good fruitfull Country, much on jnclosures as
is most of Summersetshire.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Alford 2 miles where was a minerall water
which Company resorts to for drinking—formerly it has
been more frequented than of late—many now send for
them severall miles and have Beer brewed of them—there
being no good accomodation for people of fashion, the
Country people being a Clownish rude people. Y<sup>e</sup> waters
are mostly from Alom—its a Cleare little well and a quick
spring—the bottom of the well has a sort of Blewish Clay
or Marle, its a quick purger, good for all sharpe Humers or
Obstruction. In three mile of this place is Queen Camell
famous for a fine ring of bells and for the fine sort of brown
thread called Nuns thread—as we returned from thence we
came by Bruton a very neate stone built town—from it we
ascend a very high steep hill all in a narrow Lane cut out
of the rocks on which grow trees thick, their Roots runns
amongst the rocks, and in many places fine Clean springs
buble out, and run a long out of the rocks, it smells Just like
the sea. we were full an hour passing that hill though
with four horses and a Chariot. My sister self and Maid:
thence to Willding which is a place of much water, so to
Newtontony in all 30 miles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another Journey to the Bath, from Newtontony to Warminster
18 miles a good road town and good way; thence to
Breackly 5 mile a Deep Clay way, we passed over one Common
of some miles Length on a narrow Causy that a Coach can
scarce pass, all pitched with slatts and stones—our Coach was
once wedged in y<sup>e</sup> wheele in the stones that severall men were
forced to lift us out; its made only for Packhorses which is
the way of Carriage in those parts. Y<sup>e</sup> Common is so
Moorish their feete and wheeles would sinke in, so no going
there—thence to Philip Norton 3 miles a very neate stone
built village. Thence you pass a good way between 2 stone
walls to the bath, 5 mile down a very steep hill and stony,
a mile from the town scarce any passing and there descends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>a little Current of water continually from the rocks. The
wayes to the bath are all difficult, the town lyes Low in a
bottom and its steep ascents all wayes out of the town.
The houses are indifferent, the streetes of a good size well
pitched. There are severall good houses built for Lodgings
that are new and adorned, and good furniture, the baths in
my opinion makes the town unpleasant, the aire so low,
encompassed with high hills and woods. There is 5 baths
the hot bath the most hot springs—its but small and built
all round, which makes it y<sup>e</sup> hotter—out of it runns the
water into a bath called the Le pours.</p>

<p class='c012'>The third bath is called the Cross bath w<sup>ch</sup> is some thing
bigger then the former and not so hot; the Cross in the
middle has seates round it for y<sup>e</sup> Gentlemen to sitt, and
round the walls are Arches w<sup>th</sup> seates for the Ladyes, all
stone and the seate is stone and if you thinke the seate is
too Low they raise it with a Coushon as they call it, another
Stone, but indeed the water bears you up that y<sup>e</sup> seate
seemes as easy as a down Coushon. Before the Arch the
Ladyes use to have a laced toilet hung up on the top of the
Arch and so to shelter their heads even to the water if they
please. You Generally sit up to the Neck in water, this
Cross bath is much the Coolest and is used mostly in y<sup>e</sup>
heate of summer; there are Gallery’s round y<sup>e</sup> top that y<sup>e</sup>
Company that does not Bathe that day walkes in and
lookes over into y<sup>e</sup> bath on their acquaintance and company—there
are such a number of Guides to each bath of women
to waite on y<sup>e</sup> ladyes, and of men to waite on the Gentlemen,
and they keepe their due distance. There is a
serjeant belonging to y<sup>e</sup> baths that all the bathing tyme
walkes in galleryes and takes notice order is observed and
punishes y<sup>e</sup> rude, and most people of fashion sends to him
when they begin to bathe, then he takes particular Care of
them and Complements you every morning w<sup>ch</sup> deserves its
reward at y<sup>e</sup> end of the Season. When you would walk
about y<sup>e</sup> bath I use to have a woman guide or two to Lead
me for the water is so strong it will quickly tumble you
down, and then you have 2 of the men guides goes at
a distance about y<sup>e</sup> bath to Cleare y<sup>e</sup> way. At y<sup>e</sup> sides of
the Arches are rings that you may hold by and so walke a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>little way, but y<sup>e</sup> springs bubbles up so fast and so strong
and are so hot up against ye bottoms of ones feete,
Especially in that they Call y<sup>e</sup> Kitching in the bath, which
is a great Cross with seates in y<sup>e</sup> middle and many hot
springs riseth there. The Kings bath is very large, as large
as the rest put together, in it is the hot pumpe that persons
are pumpt at for Lameness or on their heads for palsyes.
I saw one pumpt, they put on a broad brim’d hatt w<sup>th</sup> the
Crown Cut out so as y<sup>e</sup> brims Cast off y<sup>e</sup> water from y<sup>e</sup> face;
they are pumpt in y<sup>e</sup> bath, one of y<sup>e</sup> men Guides pumps—they
have two pence I thinke for 100 pumps. The water
is scallding hot out of the pump, the armes or Legs are more
easyly pumped. The Ladyes goes into the bath with
Garments made of a fine yellow canvas, which is stiff and
made large with great sleeves like a parsons gown; the
water fills it up so that its borne off that your shape is not
seen, it does not cling close as other linning, which Lookes
sadly in the poorer sort that go in their own linning. The
Gentlemen have drawers and wastcoates of the same sort
of canvas, this is the best linning, for the bath water will
Change any other yellow. When you go out of the bath
you go within a doore that leads to Steps which you ascend
by degrees that are in the water, then the doore is shut
which shutts down into the water a good way, so you are in
a private place where you still ascend severall more steps
and let your Canvass drop of by degrees into the water,
which your women guides take off, and the meane tyme
your maides flings a garment of flannell made like a Nightgown
w<sup>th</sup> great sleeves over your head, and y<sup>e</sup> guides take
y<sup>e</sup> taile and so pulls it on you Just as you rise y<sup>e</sup> steps, and
y<sup>e</sup> other garment drops off so you are wrapped up in y<sup>e</sup>
flannell and your nightgown on y<sup>e</sup> top, and your slippers
and so you are set in Chaire which is brought into y<sup>e</sup> roome
w<sup>ch</sup> are called slips, and there are Chimney’s in them, you
may have fires. These are in severall parts of the sides of
y<sup>e</sup> bath for y<sup>e</sup> Conveniency of persons going in and out of y<sup>e</sup>
bath decently, and at y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup> staires stands a woman
y<sup>t</sup> Layes a woollen Cloth for you to set your bare foot, and
also to give you attendance. Y<sup>e</sup> Chaires you go in are a
low seate and w<sup>th</sup> frames round and over y<sup>r</sup> head and all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>cover’d inside and out w<sup>th</sup> red bayes and a Curtaine drawn
before of y<sup>e</sup> same w<sup>ch</sup> makes it Close and warme; then a
Couple of men w<sup>th</sup> staves takes and Carryes you to your
lodging and sets you at y<sup>r</sup> bedside where you go to bed and
lye and sweate some tyme as you please. Y<sup>r</sup> own maides
and y<sup>e</sup> maides of the house gets your fire and waites on you
till you rise to get out of your sweate. All the baths has
the same attendance, the queens bath is bigger then y<sup>e</sup>
other three but not and neare so big as y<sup>e</sup> Kings, which do
run into each other and is only parted by a wall and at one
place a great arch where they run into each other. Y<sup>e</sup>
queens bath is a degree hotter than y<sup>e</sup> Cross bath and y<sup>e</sup>
Kings bath much hotter, these have all gallery’s round and
the pump is in one of these galleryes at y<sup>e</sup> Kings bath
which y<sup>e</sup> Company drinks of, its very hot and tastes like y<sup>e</sup>
water y<sup>t</sup> boyles Eggs, has such a smell, but y<sup>e</sup> nearer y<sup>e</sup>
pumpe you drinke it, y<sup>e</sup> hotter and less offencive and more
spiriteous. The baths are all Emptyed as soone as the
Company goes out, which is about 10 or 11 of y<sup>e</sup> Clock in
the morning; then by sluces they empty at once y<sup>e</sup> bath so
it fills againe. I have seen all y<sup>e</sup> springs bubble up as
thicke out of y<sup>e</sup> ground when the baths have been empty.
Y<sup>e</sup> bottom is gravell. So they will be full for y<sup>e</sup> evening if
Company would go in againe, if so they empty them againe
at Night and they are filled against y<sup>e</sup> morning and there
will be such a white scum on the bath w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup> guides goes
and scimms off Cleane before any Company goes in; if they
go in while this scum is on it gives them the bath mantle as
they call it, makes them breake out into heate and pimples;
y<sup>e</sup> like will be on them if they go into y<sup>e</sup> bath before they
have purged, especially in y<sup>e</sup> hotter bath. Y<sup>e</sup> places for
divertion about y<sup>e</sup> bath is either y<sup>e</sup> walkes in that they call
y<sup>e</sup> Kings Mead which is a pleasant green meaddow, where
are walkes round and Cross it, no place for Coaches, and
indeed there is little use of a Coach only to bring and
Carry y<sup>e</sup> Company from y<sup>e</sup> bath for y<sup>e</sup> wayes are not proper
for Coaches.</p>

<p class='c012'>Y<sup>e</sup> town and all its accomodations is adapted to y<sup>e</sup>
batheing and drinking of the waters and to nothing else,
the streetes are well pitched and Cleane kept and there are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>Chaires as in London to Carry y<sup>e</sup> better sort of people in
visits, or if sick or infirme and is only in the town, for its so
Encompassed with high hills few care to take the aire on
them. There is also pleasant walkes in y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall in the
Cloysters and y<sup>t</sup> leades to y<sup>e</sup> discription of the Coronation
in this place at y<sup>e</sup> bath y<sup>e</sup> 23<sup>d</sup> April w<sup>ch</sup> I recieved y<sup>e</sup> relation
off from a spectatrix it being y<sup>e</sup> day queen ann was
Crowned, and is never performed unless when a queen is
the Chiefe as Queen Elizabeth &amp;c., her Sister our late
Majesty’s King William and Queen Mary because the
queen was Joyn’d in the throne as principle, they representing
y<sup>e</sup> Amazons consisting of the young Maids. The
Companyes of the town being assembled at M<sup>r</sup> Mayors
house begin to proceed with their officers masters and
wardens and each Company with their flag—After marched
in a troupe y<sup>e</sup> Maides of the suburbs each with their proper
officers of themselves, as Capt<sup>n</sup> Ensigne and lieutenant w<sup>th</sup>
plummes of feathers. Just before y<sup>e</sup> capt<sup>n</sup> went her guard
which was 6 young men drest in their holland shirts, with
garters, and Ribons in their hatts, and their swords drawn
in their hands, then the capt<sup>n</sup> in her short wastecoate with
gold lace, and their peticoates silke y<sup>t</sup> were with furbellows
ode above anoth<sup>er</sup> with Ribons, w<sup>th</sup> a trunchant in their
hand w<sup>th</sup> an inscription, God save queen Ann. Just behinde
their Captaines went two Maides with two scepters gilt,
next them two more y<sup>t</sup> bore the crown between them w<sup>ch</sup>
was gilt, also their Ensigne. Their flag w<sup>ch</sup> holds the same
inscription God save queen Ann was guarded by two young
Men drest as y<sup>e</sup> others in their holland shirts: then the
troupe followed in order in same dress as their officers with
Crowns on their heads of Guilded Lauwrell, in Number
about 100; next came y<sup>e</sup> Citty Maides w<sup>th</sup> their Majoress
Generall with their plummes of feather with a wreath of
Gilded Lawrell like a Crown, and on y<sup>e</sup> top w<sup>th</sup> all sorts of
pretious stones y<sup>e</sup> Jewellers shops Could supply them w<sup>th</sup>
and were guarded w<sup>th</sup> young men as y<sup>e</sup> others; behind y<sup>e</sup>
Majoress followed six all in white with a green Cross
swathe with this inscription in white God save queen Ann
each with their Trunchant in their hands as y<sup>e</sup> former, and
two carrying 2 scepters gilt, and after them two more y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Crown between them, w<sup>ch</sup> was very rich in pearles; then
two more carryed y<sup>e</sup> queens Armes between them, their
dress was just as y<sup>e</sup> first were only much richer and finer
and all of them gather’d up y<sup>e</sup> upper peticoate in little
scallops just to shew their under peticoates w<sup>ch</sup> were white.
Y<sup>e</sup> troupe of y<sup>e</sup> amazans in order w<sup>th</sup> their bows and arrows
w<sup>th</sup> Crowns of Gilded Lawrel, their officers had plumes of
feathers and their Serjeants with their halberts, their
number was also about 100.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next after followed all y<sup>e</sup> young men of y<sup>e</sup> town form’d
into a Company of Granadeers w<sup>th</sup> their proper officers w<sup>ch</sup>
had laced hatts and plumes of feathers; each soldier had a
red cap w<sup>th</sup> Cyphers and a Crown gilt w<sup>th</sup> gold and furbelowed
with blew round their head; their hair was tyed back with
scarlet ribon, they had scarlet garters and scarlet slings for
their gunns; drest all in their holland shirts and white
stockings and had a hanger by their sides. their number
was about 30. Next followed four couple of Maurice
dancers with their pranceing horses, in holland shirts with
laced hatt riboned, and Cross swashes and garters w<sup>th</sup> bells,
w<sup>th</sup> their two antiques drest in their formalityes, w<sup>th</sup> hankershiefs
in their hands danceing all y<sup>e</sup> way.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next walked y<sup>e</sup> Clergy, then next followed M<sup>r</sup> Major
with two pages attending him, followed by the Corporation
aldermen all in their scarlet gowns, and the common Councill
in their gowns. Next followed in y<sup>e</sup> reare all y<sup>e</sup> marryed
men formed into a Company of Artilery, their hatts Laced,
with plumes of feathers all in their own Cloths:</p>

<p class='c012'>Ye Soldiers y<sup>e</sup> Same w<sup>th</sup> Swords and gunns w<sup>th</sup> two
Blunderbusses; every Company both of men and women
was attended by drums and all sort of musick both wind and
stringed instruments.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thus they repaired to y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall, Y<sup>e</sup> granadeers
salutes them Just as they enter the Abby with a volly of
shott, and there they have a sermon and as they come out
of the Cathedrall y<sup>e</sup> Company of artillery salutes them
againe with another volly, so in the same order they
return to their Guild Hall where is a sumptuous feast w<sup>th</sup>
Musick and danceing w<sup>ch</sup> Ends y<sup>e</sup> solemnity w<sup>th</sup> bonfires as
is usual.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span> I now proceed to describe the rest of the town. there
are green walkes very pleasant and in many places, and
out of the Cathedrall you walk into y<sup>e</sup> priory which has
good walkes of rows of trees, which is pleasant—there are
y<sup>e</sup> deans prebends and doctors houses which stand in y<sup>t</sup>
green which is pleasant, by y<sup>e</sup> Church called the Abby, w<sup>ch</sup>
is lofty and spacious and much Company walke there
especially in wet weather. Y<sup>e</sup> Quire is neat but nothing
extraordinary—in that Kings mead there are severall little
Cake-houses where you have fruit lulibubs and sumes
Liquours to entertaine y<sup>e</sup> Company that walke there.</p>

<p class='c012'>The markets are very good here of all sorts of provision
flesh and ffish especially when the season for y<sup>e</sup> Company
batheing and drinking lasts, great plenty and pretty reasonable.
The Chargeableness of the bath is y<sup>e</sup> Lodgings and
fireing, the ffaggotts being very small, but they give you
very good attendance there.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another Journey I went with my mother into Oxfordshire,
by Barkshire to Hungerford 16 mile, which is famous
for Crawfish there being a good river and great quantityes
of y<sup>t</sup> fish and large.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is in Barkshire, thence to Lamborn w<sup>ch</sup> is a woody
Country 7 miles, thence to ffarington 7 mile a pretty large
place but lyes very watry, and so by Radcote 5 miles, w<sup>ch</sup> is
much y<sup>e</sup> same deep Countryes much on Clay; by ffarington
is a fine house of S<sup>r</sup> George Pratt’s Called Coalsell.
All y<sup>e</sup> avenues to y<sup>e</sup> house are fine walkes of rows of trees,
y<sup>e</sup> garden lyes in a great descent below y<sup>e</sup> house of many
steps and terresses and walkes one below another, a green
walke with all sorts of Dwarfe trees, fruit trees with standing
apricot and flower trees, abundance of garden roome
and filled with all sorts of things improved for pleasure and
use. The house is new built with stone, most of y<sup>e</sup> offices
are partly under ground—Kitchin, Pantry, buttlery and good
Cellers and round a Court is all y<sup>e</sup> other offices and out
houses; this is all even with y<sup>e</sup> back yards. The Entrance
of y<sup>e</sup> house is an ascent of severall steps into a hall so lofty
the rooff is three storyes, reaches to y<sup>e</sup> floore of y<sup>e</sup> gallery—all
the walls are Cutt in hollows where statues and Heads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Carved ffinely are sett, Directly fore-right Enters a large
Dineing roome or great parlour, which has a door thourough
into the garden y<sup>t</sup> gives a visto through y<sup>e</sup> house: within y<sup>t</sup>
is a drawing room, on y<sup>e</sup> other side another roome of the
same size, and backward is a little parlour all with good
ffurniture, tapistry, Damaske, &amp;c. There runs up a p<sup>r</sup> of
back Staires at each end of the house quite to y<sup>e</sup> top to the
gallery which does make convenient all y<sup>e</sup> Chambers. The
great Staires goes out of the hall on each side, spacious and
handsom staires runs up and meetes on the landing place,
w<sup>ch</sup> is a passage that runs on both sides to each end of the
house, but is made private by two doores on each side: on
the top of the staires you enter in y<sup>e</sup> midle into a dineing
roome, within that a Chamber on each side with two
Closets to each bigg Enough for a little bed, with Chimney’s
convenient for a servant and for dressing roomes, one of
which has a doore also out into that passage and soe to the
back staires; this is y<sup>e</sup> same on y<sup>e</sup> other end, and also two
roomes on y<sup>e</sup> other side, each end of y<sup>e</sup> hall which continues
to run up even with the second story, which are all good
Chambers, and one more here because the great staires goe
but to y<sup>e</sup> first story: they are all well and Genteel’ly
furnisht, damaskes Chamlet and wrought beds ffashionably
made up. Over this runs a gallery all through the house,
and on each side severall garret roomes for servants
ffurnished very neate and Genteele, in y<sup>e</sup> middle are staires
y<sup>t</sup> Lead up to the Cupilow or large Lanthorn in the middle
of the leads. Y<sup>e</sup> house being Leaded all over and the stone
Chimney’s in severall rows Comes up in them on each side
y<sup>e</sup> Cupilow, it shewes exact and very uniform, as is y<sup>e</sup> whole
Building. This gives you a great prospect of gardens,
grounds and woods that appertaine to y<sup>e</sup> Seate, as well as a
sight of the Country at a distance. There was few pictures
in the house only over doores and Chimney’s; the hall was
paved with black and whyte marble and had seates round
the roome cut in arches on the walls. From thence Oxfordshire
we enter over the Vale of the White horse w<sup>ch</sup> takes
its name from a Ridge of high hills on which is Cutt out the
shape off a horse in perfect proportions in broad wayes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>and is seen a great distance very plaine, the hills being on
Chalke look’s white and the great valley in the bottom is
term’d the Manger; it extends a vast way, a rich jnclosed
Country, and we pass through some part of Glocestershire
at Norton where is another seat of my Brother Say’s—thence
to Broughton by Banbery which is 25 mile.</p>

<p class='c012'>Broughton is an ancient Seate of y<sup>e</sup> Lord viscount Say
and Seale; its an old house moted round, and a parke and
Gardens, but are much left to decay and ruine when my
brother Came to it. He has two other houses in two or
three Miles, Shettford a little neate house and gardens, and
Newton, but that is mostly pulled down. From Broughton
I went to see Edgehill where was the ffamous Battle ffought
in Cromwell’s tyme—its 10 mile off, the Ridge of hills
runns a great length and so high that the land beneath it
appeares vastly distant, its a rich ground full of inclosures
and lookes finely, tho’ fformidable to look down on it and
turnes one’s head round—the wind allwayes blows w<sup>th</sup> great
violence there because of the Steepeness of y<sup>e</sup> hills. The
top is a flatt full of Barrows and hills that are markes of a
Camp and battles.</p>

<p class='c012'>About 2 mile from Broughton is a great old house much
like Broughton; its S<sup>r</sup> Robert Dashwoods—most of the
great houses there about are old built. About three mile
off at Adderbery w<sup>ch</sup> is a pretty neate vilage, there are two
or three good houses one of S<sup>r</sup> Thomas Cobbs and Lady
Rochesters looks neate and well with good gardens.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is about 2 mile off the Lord Guilffords house
Roxton which is a good house within a parke. You enter a
large hall, on the left hand leads to a little parlour down to
y<sup>e</sup> Kitchins, the halfe pace att the upper end of the hall leads
into dineing roome, drawing roome, and a large staire-case
with good pictures; there you enter another large dineing
roome with great Compass windows and fine Pictures of the
family. Within is a drawing roome and Chambers and
Closets well proportioned, little or no ffurniture was up,
only in y<sup>e</sup> worst roomes; in one Closet att each doore was
Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth’s pictures to the ffoote in
bibb and apron very pretty: in one roome was the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>North and Ladyes picture, which was Lord Chiefe Justice
and their sonnes picture in the middle, all at length,—many
good Pictures in most roomes. There was a part new built
all the new ffashion way which was designed for the present
Lord Gilford and Lady. The Gardens are very good, the
outhouses and Stables handsome.</p>

<p class='c012'>Banbury is a pretty little town, the streets broad and well
pitched, the whole Country is very pleasant and the land
rich—a red earth. They make some of their fences with
stones—dry walls without Morter. It seemes much on a
flatt and you have a large prospect, from thence to London
we go by Alesbury 20 mile, thence to London 30 mile.</p>

<p class='c012'>A journey my mother went from Newtontony to Durly
in the fforest 15 miles, thence to Nurstead 15 mile to a
Relations house, (Aunt Holts,) a neate new built house with
brick and stone—a hall, little parlour on y<sup>e</sup> left side, a back
door into a Court built round with all the offices out to y<sup>e</sup>
stables and barnes: on the right side a great parlour and
drawing roome y<sup>t</sup> opened into the garden w<sup>ch</sup> were fine gravel
walks, grass plotts and beyond it a garden of flower trees and
all sorts of Herbage, store of fruit, and freestone broad walke
in y<sup>e</sup> Middle to y<sup>e</sup> house. Y<sup>e</sup> Chambers are very good and
Convenient and in y<sup>e</sup> ffront is a place walled in, beyond is a
long ground sett with rows of trees; on y<sup>e</sup> right side of y<sup>e</sup>
house is a large grove of firrs halfe scotts halfe norroway
which lookes very nobly. The roades all about this Country
are very stony, narrow and steep hills or else very dirty as in
most of Sussex, but good rich land; it is in 2 mile of petersffield
in Hampshire w<sup>ch</sup> is a good little neate town. In a
mile of it is a Gentlemans house Called Maple Duram which
Might now be new named into yew, ffor the great number of
yew trees set thick in severall green walkes that grows high
and is cutt close to the body up almost to the top, and y<sup>e</sup>
tops are left in a great head that spreads and makes it very
shady and pleasant. From thence we went to Guilford w<sup>ch</sup>
is a good town built with stone. The streetes are broad—thence
to Kingston on the Thames 30 mile thence to London
10 mile, from London againe to Colebrooke 15 miles, thence
to Maidenhead 10. You go in sight of Winsor Castle on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>the left hand and Eaton Colledge as you pass the bridge at
Maidenhead, and on y<sup>e</sup> right hand you see Cliffton house a
fine Building of y<sup>e</sup> Duke of Buckingams. Thence to Redding
5 miles w<sup>ch</sup> is a pretty large place, severall Churches, in
one lyes buried one of my sisters that Dyed at my Grandmothers
there of the small pox, her monument of white
marble stands up in the Chancell. From Redding to the
Veale 5 miles, Sad Clay Deep way this is in Barkshire,
thence to Newbery 8 mile all Clay Mirey ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>Newbery is a little town famous for makeing the best
whipps—its a good market for Corn and trade. Thence to
Newtontony over Way hill famous for a Faire kept there on
Michelmas day.</p>

<p class='c012'>My journey to London after my Mothers death was by
Sutton 14 mile thence to Baseing stoke 12 mile, a large
town for to Entertaine travellers and commodious, 2 mile
beyond we pass by Basen on the left side, a house of the
Duke of Boltons w<sup>th</sup> a large parke and gardens. Y<sup>e</sup> house
is not fine being much demolished and spoyled after the
Civil warres, it being a garrison held by y<sup>e</sup> King. On the
right hand at a mile distance you come in sight also of a
great building like a little town—the house of S<sup>r</sup> Robert
Hendlys; so to Hartffordbridge is 8 mile more thats only a
place full of jnns for the conveniency of the road. Thence
over a heath you go to Bagshott that is 8 mile all on a
heavy sand where you come by a parke of y<sup>e</sup> kings, and in
it is a pretty house—thence to Eggum 8 mile very heavy
sand, so to Staines where you cross the Thames on a bridge
to Midlsex and so to Houndslow 4 mile, to Brandford 4
mile, to Turnumgreen 2, thence to Hammersmith 2 to
Kensington 2 and London 2 miles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another journey ffrom London to Alsebury 30 mile, from
thence to great Horrwood in Buckinghamshire 10 miles,
from thence I went to Hillsdon a house of Mr Dentons 7
miles which stands on a Riseing in the middle of a fine
Parke and lookes very well; its not large, a good hall w<sup>th</sup> 2
parlours and has a glide through the house into the gardens
w<sup>ch</sup> are neately kept—the grass and Gravel walkes w<sup>th</sup> dwarfs
and flower beds and much fruit; the prospect is fine all over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the gardens and parke, and the river and woods beyond
them. We went to Thorndon S<sup>r</sup> Thomas Tyrrells, a good
old house and very good gardens, some walkes like Arbours
Close, others shady others open, some gravel, others grass
with Cyprus’ trees, a fine river runnes all the back side of
the garden, where is very good ffish. The house is low but
runnes much on the ground, so there are many roomes w<sup>ch</sup>
are lofty but its not built in many storyes. Thence we
went 4 mile to Stow S<sup>r</sup> Rich<sup>d</sup> Temples new house that stands
pretty high. You enter into a hall very lofty with a gallery
round the top, thence through to a great parlour that opens
in a Bellcony to the garden, and is a visto thro’ the whole
house, so that on the one side you view the gardens w<sup>ch</sup> are
one below another w<sup>th</sup> low breast walls and Taress walkes,
and is replenished with all y<sup>e</sup> Curiosityes or Requisites for
ornament, pleasure and use, beyond it are orchards and
woods with rows of trees; on the other side you see y<sup>e</sup>
parke rowes of trees; the roomes are all lofty and good, the
hall is not large but sutable to its height—a great many
Chambers and roomes of state. Some the ground floores are
inlaid, ffine Pictures and good staircase and gallery w<sup>ch</sup> leads
to the Ledds through a large Cupelow w<sup>ch</sup> gives y<sup>e</sup> prospect
of the whole Country. We went to horrwood 7 mile, by
severall other seates of S<sup>r</sup> Ralph Verny’s who has most
exact ffine gardens: within two mile off Horrwood is a well
of minerall waters from Iron just like Tunbridg and as good.
I dranke them a fortnight—there are severall of the same
sort of springs all about that Country. Thence I went to
Buckinghamtown 7 mile, a very neate place and we passed
the river Ouise over a very high bridge tho’ the river seemed
not then so very full, but it swells after great raines which
makes them build their arches so large. Thence to Banbury
in Oxfordshire 13 miles, thence to morton Hindmost in
Glocestershire 14 miles, thence to Hales 8 miles over steep
stony hills, a house of Lord Tracy’s where my brother Say
lived—a good old house, and there is a pretty Chappel with
a Gallery ffor people of quality to sitt in w<sup>ch</sup> goes out of the
hall that is a lofty large roome: good parlour and severall
good lodging roomes. You ascend into the house by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>Severall stone stepps. Within 2 mile of this is a better
house of y<sup>e</sup> Lord Tracy with a very good parke which
stands so high that by the Lodge I rode up y<sup>e</sup> banks I
could see all the parke about and y<sup>e</sup> deer feeding and
running.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a little river and large ponds—it gives you a
good sight of the Country about, w<sup>ch</sup> is pretty much inclosed
and woods a rich deep Country and so the roads bad.
There are severall high hills that I was on that gave a large
prospect to y<sup>e</sup> eye. I saw some of this land improved in
the produce of woods w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup> dyers use—its ordered in this
manner, all the Summer season if drie for 4 or 5 months
they sow it or plant it, but I thinke its sown—then its very
Clean wedd when grown up a little out of y<sup>e</sup> ground, for it
rises no higher then Lettice and Much in such tuffts; y<sup>e</sup>
Coullour off y<sup>e</sup> Leafe is much like Scabins and the shape
Resembling that: this they Cutt of Close to y<sup>e</sup> ground and
soe out of y<sup>e</sup> same roofe Springs the Leafe againe, this they
do 4 tymes, then in a Mill w<sup>th</sup> a horse they Grind the
Leaves into a paste, so make it up in balls and drye them
in a Penthouse to secure it from raine—only the wind dryes
it. This plantation of about 12 acres would Employ 2 or 3
ffamilyes Men, Women and Children, and so they Generally
Come and Make little hutts for themselves for y<sup>e</sup> Season to
tend it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here I saw flax In the growth. The smell of the Woode
is so strong and offencive you can scarce beare it at y<sup>e</sup> Mill:
I could not fforse my horse neare it.</p>

<p class='c012'>ffrom thence I returned. Backe by a place where is a
stone stands to Divide ffour shires—Worcester, Oxford
Glocester and Warwickshire—so I ascended there a high
hill and travaill’d all on y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup> hills a pleasant and a
good Roade. I came to Rowle Stone where are many
such greate stones as is at Stonidge, one stands uppright,
a broad Stone Called the King’s Stone, being the place
a Saxon King was secured against his enemies; thence
to Broughton in all 26 miles. Thence I went to Astrop
where is a Steele water Much ffrequented by y<sup>e</sup> Gentry, it
has some Mixture of Allum so is not so strong as Tunbridge.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>There is a ffine Gravell Walke that is between 2
high Cutt hedges where is a Roome for the Musick and a
Roome for y<sup>e</sup> Company besides y<sup>e</sup> Private walkes. The
well runnes very quick, they are not Curious in keepeing it,
neither is there any bason for the spring to run out off only
a dirty well full of Moss’s which is all Changed yellow by
the water. There are Lodgings about for y<sup>e</sup> Company and
a little place Called Sutton. this is four mile, thence to
Oxfford 14 mile all in a very good Road and an exceeding
pleasant Country. You pass by many ffine seates, Park’s,
woods, the Land in Most part of this County is Rich Red
Mould and deepe so as they are forced to Plough their
Ground 2 or 3 tymes for wheate and Cannot use Wheeles
to their Ploughs, its rich Land and produces plenty of all
things.</p>

<p class='c012'>Oxford opens to view 2 mile off, its Scituation is ffine on
a Round hill Environ’d Round with hills adorn’d with
Woods and Enclosures, yet not so neare as to annoy y<sup>e</sup>
town which stands pleasant and Compact. There is a ffine
Causy for neare two mile by the Road for the Schollars to
walke on, y<sup>e</sup> Theater stands the highest of all and much in
y<sup>e</sup> middle Encompass’d with y<sup>e</sup> Severall Colledges and
Churches and other Buildings whose towers and Spires
appeares very Well at a Distance; the Streetes are very
Cleane and well Pitched and pretty broad. The high
Streete is a very Noble one, soe Larg and of a Greate
Length. In this is y<sup>e</sup> University Church Called S<sup>t</sup> Maryes,
which is very large and Lofty but Nothing very Curious in
it. The Theater is a Noble Pile of building, its Paved with
Black and White Marble, exceeding Large and Lofty, built
Round and Supported by its own architecture all stone, noe
pillars to support it; itt has windows all round and full of
Gallery’s ffor the Spectators as well as Disputants when y<sup>e</sup>
acts are at Oxford. Over the Rooff of this Large Roome
are as Large roomes with Severall Divissions which are Used
for the Drying the Printed Sheetes of bookes, and this has
Light in Ovalls which is quite Round the Theater and in
the Middle is a large Cupelow or Lanthorne Whence your
Eye has a very ffine view of y<sup>e</sup> whole town and Country;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>this is all Supported on its own work. Under the theater
is a roome w<sup>ch</sup> is ffitted for printing, where I printed My
name Severall tymes. The outside of y<sup>e</sup> theater there is a
pavement and spikes of Iron in a Raile round with pillars
of stone to secure it from the street. Just by it is a little
building w<sup>ch</sup> is full of Antiquityes w<sup>ch</sup> have many Curiositys
in it of Mettles, Stones, Ambers, Gumms.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is the picture of a Gentleman y<sup>t</sup> was a Great
benefactor to it being a travailer; the fframe of his picture
is all wood carved very finely with all sorts of figures,
Leaves, birds, beast and flowers. He gave them 2 ffine
gold Meddals or Silve gilt w<sup>th</sup> two ffine great Chaines of
the same, one was all curious hollow worke w<sup>ch</sup> were given
him by some prince beyond the Sea. There is a Cane
which looks like a Solid heavy thing but if you take it in
yo<sup>r</sup> hands its as light as a feather, there is a Dwarfe shoe
and boote, there are several Loadstones, and it is pretty to
See how y<sup>e</sup> steele Clings or follows it, hold it on the top att
some distance the needles stand quite upright, hold it on
either side it moves towards it as it rises and falls.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are several good Colledges I saw most of y<sup>m</sup>.
Waddom hall is but little; in Trinity Colledge is a fine
neate Chapple, new made, finely painted. Christ Church is
y<sup>e</sup> largest Colledge. The Courts large, y<sup>e</sup> buildings large
and lofty; in one of the Courts is a tower new built for to
hang the Mighty Tom, that bell is of a Large size, so great
a Weight they were forced to have engines from London to
raise it up to the tower. There is a fine ring of bells in y<sup>e</sup>
Colledge S<sup>t</sup> Magdalines, its just by the river, there is to
Maudline Hall (which is a very large and good Cloyster) a
very fine gravell walk, two or 3 may walke abreast, and
Rows of trees on either side, and this is round a water w<sup>ch</sup>
Makes it very pleasant.</p>

<p class='c012'>S<sup>t</sup> Johns Colledge had fine gardens and walkes but I did
but just look into it, so I did into kings, and queens
Colledges, and severall of the rest I looked into, they are
much alike in building but none so large as Christ Church
Colledge. I was in New Colledge w<sup>ch</sup> is very neate, but not
large, the buildings good, Y<sup>e</sup> Chapple very fine; Ye Garden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>was new makeing, there is a large bason of water In the
Middle there is little walkes and mazes and round mounts
for the schollars to divert themselves.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Corpus Christus Colledge w<sup>ch</sup> is but small there I was
entertained at supper and eate of their very good bread and
beare which is remarkably the best anywhere Oxford
Bread is.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Physick garden afforded great diversion and pleasure,
the variety of flowers and plants would have entertained
one a week. The few remarkable things I tooke notice off
was y<sup>e</sup> Aloes plant w<sup>ch</sup> is like a great flag in shape, leaves
and Coullour, and grows in the fform of an open Hartichoake
and towards the bottom of each Leafe its very broad and
thicke, In w<sup>ch</sup> there are hollows or receptacles for y<sup>e</sup> Aloes.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is also y<sup>e</sup> sensible plant, take but a Leafe between
finger and thumb and squeeze it and it immediately Curles
up together as if pained and after some tyme opens abroad
again, it looks in Coullour like a filbert Leafe but much
narrower and long. There is also the humble plant that
grows on a long slender Stalke and do but strike it, it falls
flatt on y<sup>e</sup> ground stalke and all, and after some tyme
revives againe and Stands up, but these are nice plants and
are kept mostly under Glass’s, y<sup>e</sup> aire being too rough for
them. There is y<sup>e</sup> wormwood sage Called Mountaigne sage,
its to all appearance like Comon sage only of yellower green,
a narrow long Leafe full of ribbs; In yo<sup>r</sup> Mouth the flavour
is strong of Wormwood to the taste. The library is as large
as 2 or 3 roomes but old and a little disreguarded except
one part w<sup>ch</sup> is parted from the rest, wansecoated and fitted
up neate and painted which was done by King james y<sup>e</sup>
Second w<sup>n</sup> he designed Maudling Colledg for his priests A
Seminary. Here I met w<sup>th</sup> some of my relations who
accompanyed me about to see some of the Colledges I had
not seen before, S<sup>t</sup> John’s Colledge which is large and has a
ffine Garden at one Entrance of it with Large Iron-gates
Carved and Gilt; its built round two Courts: the Library is
two walks, one out of the other the inner one has severall
Anatomy’s in Cases and some other Curiosity of Shells, stone,
bristol Diamonds, skins of ffish and beasts. Here they have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>the Great Curiosity Much spoken off King Charles the ffirsts
Picture; Y<sup>e</sup> whole Lines of fface band and garment to the
Shoulders and armes and garter is all written hand and
Containes the whole Comon prayer, itts very small the
Character, but where a straight Line is you May read a word
or two; there is another of Gustaus Adolphus whose
portraiture is represented to the Eye in writeing alsoe and
Contains his whole Life and prowess; there is alsoe the
Lord’s prayer and ten Commandments in the Compass of a
Crown piece; there are also Severall books all of writing on
vellum Leaves, and one book written in y<sup>e</sup> Chinease Caractor
on the jndian barks off trees; there is alsoe a Book of the
Genealogies of the Kings since the Conquest to King
Charles the Second, with the Severall Coates all Gilded
very fresh till the two or three Last w<sup>ch</sup> is pretended to be
difficient from the art being Lost of Laying Gold so ffine on
anything to polish it, but thats a great Mistake for that art
is still in use in England, but the Excuse served the Negligence
or jgnorance of the workman; there was alsoe One
book w<sup>th</sup> severall Cutts in it off y<sup>e</sup> Conception of Christ till
his Ascention. There was alsoe a ffine prayer book or Mass
book of Q. Marias, this was in the new part of the Library
which was neately wanscoated and adorned. There is a
ffine grove of trees and walks all walled round.</p>

<p class='c012'>Queens Colledge Library is all new and a stately building
Emulating that of Christ Church in Cambridge, it is not
so large and stands on one range of Pillars of stone, the
other ffront being all with Statues in Stone, in Nitches and
Carved adornements and on the tops ffigures and statues.
The Staircase is pretty broad but not so ffinely wanscoated
or Carved as that at Cambridge, the roomes is Lofty, but not
so large, Well Wanscoated and there is good Carvings; its
Mostly full of Books in the severall divisions and great
Globes, its boarded Under foot, there is no ballcoany because
the prospect is but to a dead wall, its very handsom.</p>

<p class='c012'>Trinity Colledge Chapple which was not ffinish’d the
Last tyme I was at Oxford but now it is a Beautifull
Magnifficent Structure. Its Lofty and Curiously painted—the
Rooffe and Sides y<sup>e</sup> history of Christ’s ascention a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>very ffine Carving of thin white wood just Like that at
Windsor it being the same hand. The whole Chappel is
Wanscoated with Walnut tree and the fine sweet wood y<sup>e</sup>
same y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Lord Oxfford brought over when high admiral
of England, and has wanscoated his hall and staircase with.
It is sweet like Cedar and of a Reddish Coull<sup>r</sup>, but y<sup>e</sup>
graine much ffiner and well vein’d.</p>

<p class='c012'>New Colledge which belongs to the ffiennes’s, William
of Wickam the founder, so I look’d on myself as some way
a little Interested in that, here I was very handsomly
Entertained by M<sup>r</sup> Cross w<sup>ch</sup> was one of my nephew Say
and Seale’s Tutors when at Oxfford. These ffellowshipp
in New Colledge are about 100 say and a very pretty
appartinent of Dineing Roome, bed Chamber, a studdy and
a room for a Servant, tho’ y<sup>e</sup> Serviteurs of the Colledge
gives attendance; and here they may Live very Neatly and
well if Sober and have all their Curiosityes they take much
delight in, greens of all sorts, Myrtle, oringe and Lemons and
Lorrestine growing in potts of Earth and so moved about
from place to place and into the aire sometymes. There
are severall New Lodgings added and beautifyed here, the
Gardens also w<sup>th</sup> gravell and Grass walkes, some shady and
a great mount in the Middle w<sup>ch</sup> is ascended by Degrees
in a round of Green paths deffended by greens cutt Low, and
on y<sup>e</sup> top is a summer house. Beyond these Gardens is a
bowling-green and round it a Close shady walke, walled
round and a Cutt hedge to the bowling-green.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are in Oxford 18 Colledges and Six halls viz. New
Colledge, Christ Church, Martin Colledge, Corpus Christy
Colledge, Magdalen Colledge, University Coll, Pembroke
Colledge, Linghorn Colledge, which is overlook’t by the
Devil, Brasen-nose Colledge, Wadham Colledge, Queens
Colledge, Belial Colledge, Orrel Colledge, Trinity Colledge,
Exetter Colledge, All-souls Colledge, Jesus Colledge, S<sup>t</sup> Johns
Colledge,—halls 7 viz Alben hall, Maudlin hall, Newin hall,
Hart Hall, Glocester hall, S<sup>t</sup> Mary hall, and Edmond hall.
There is a very odd Custom In Queen Coll. for every new-years-day,
there is a Certain Sum Laid out In Needles and
thread w<sup>ch</sup> was Left by y<sup>e</sup> founder and every Gentleman of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>that Colledge has one given him w<sup>th</sup> these words: Take this
and be thrifty.</p>

<p class='c012'>In New Colledge Garden in y<sup>e</sup> plott there is y<sup>e</sup> Colledg
Armes Cutt in box and y<sup>e</sup> 24 Letters round it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next plott a sun-dial cutt in box and true-Lovers knotts;
att y<sup>e</sup> entrance of y<sup>e</sup> Colledge over y<sup>e</sup> gate is the ffiennes’s
and y<sup>e</sup> Wickhams Arms Cutt in stone Sett up there by my
Nephew Say when he was at y<sup>e</sup> Colledge before his travels.
There is a large stone statue in the Middle of y<sup>e</sup> first
quadrangle of William of Wickhams y<sup>e</sup> ffounder, railed in
w<sup>th</sup> Iron Grates.</p>

<p class='c012'>In y<sup>e</sup> Library are y<sup>e</sup> pictures of some of y<sup>e</sup> learned men
w<sup>ch</sup> belonged formerly to the University.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Oxford I went to Abington and Cross’d y<sup>e</sup> River
Thames on a bridge att y<sup>e</sup> end of y<sup>e</sup> town and so Entered
into Barkshire and rode along by y<sup>e</sup> thames side a good
way, w<sup>ch</sup> was full of Barges and Lighters—its 6 mile to
Abington. Before I proceed will Insert y<sup>e</sup> names of y<sup>e</sup>
ffounders of y<sup>e</sup> halls and Colledges in Oxford. University
Colledge was founded by King Alfred. Baliol Coll. was
founded by John and David Baliol, Merton Coll. by Walter
de Mert, Exetter Coll. by Walter Stapleton, Oriel Colledge
by King Edward the second, Queen Coll. by Robert Egglesfield,
New Colledge by W<sup>m</sup> of Wickham, Lincoln Colledge

White, Alton Hall by y<sup>e</sup> abbess of Alban, St Edmond Hall
by y<sup>e</sup> arch Bishop of Canterbury.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence I went to Abington. Abington town seemes
a very well built town and the Market Cross is the ffinest
in England, its all of free stone and very Lofty; Even ye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Isles or Walk below is a Lofty arch on severall Pillars of
square Stone and four square Pillars: over it are Large
Roomes with handsome windows, above w<sup>ch</sup> is some
Roomes with Windows and Little Like the Theatre att
Oxford only this is a Square building and that round, it
makes a very ffine appearance.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence I went to Elsly 8 mile farther, a little
Market town, good Inns thence Newbury. Most of this
way is much on Downs and good Roads, its 7 mile to
Newbury where I called on an old acquaintance Marryed
to a tradesman M<sup>r</sup> Every, who is so Like the Minister his
Uncle y<sup>t</sup> was my acquaintance. Here I staid an hour and
then proceeded on to Basenstoke 12 long miles, being my
ready road to Chichister, and from Basenstoke to Alton
8 mile and from thence to Petersffield and to Nurstead
11 long Miles, this was in Hampshire so was Basenstoke:
here I lay at a Relations House M<sup>r</sup> Holt that marry’d My
Mothers sister. From thence I went to Chichester through
a very ffine Parke of the Lord Tankervailes, stately woods
and shady tall trees at Least 2 mile, in y<sup>e</sup> Middle stands his
house w<sup>ch</sup> is new built, square, 9 windows in y<sup>e</sup> ffront and
seven in the sides. Brickwork w<sup>th</sup> free stone coynes and
windows, itts in the Midst of fine gardens, Gravell and Grass
walks and bowling green, w<sup>th</sup> breast walls Divideing each
from other, and so discovers the whole to view. Att ye
Entrance a Large Coart w<sup>th</sup> Iron gates open w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to
a less, ascending some stepps, ffree stone in a round, thence
up More Stepps to a terrass, so to the house; it looks very
neate and all orchards and yards convenient. Thence I
entered into Sussex and soe Chichester, w<sup>ch</sup> is 12 miles.
This is but a Little Citty Encompass’d with a wall w<sup>th</sup> 4
gates which Casts the two streetes directly across each other
and so Lookes through from Gate to Gate, one Streete
does, the other it seemes did so formerly, but in new building
of some of their houses they have encroach’d into the
Streete and so hinders the through visto. In Midst of
these 2 or 4 streetes Divided by the Market place is a very
faire Cross of Stone Like a Church or greate arch, its pretty
Large and pirramydy form w<sup>th</sup> severall Carvings. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Cathedrall is pretty Lofty, y<sup>e</sup> painting on y<sup>e</sup> Roofe in the
quire and Isles Looked very ffresh tho’ 300 yeares old, there
is in the jsle on y<sup>e</sup> roofe y<sup>e</sup> phaney of 6 faces joyned and 6
eyes and yet each face has two eyes and in another place
the faces turned outward and so the 6 faces are 12 eyes.
The Quire is good, there is a fixed pulpit in it overight y<sup>e</sup>
Bishops seate w<sup>ch</sup> is not usual, I never saw it before—Usually
they have pulpits that are Moveable.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a faire Organ and another pulpit in y<sup>e</sup> body of
the Church, there is also an entire Church in y<sup>e</sup> Cathedral by
it self w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> parish Church. There are in all 6 parishes
and so many Churches besides y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall. Over the
alter is painted glass Chequer’d blew white and Red, so deepe
the Coull<sup>r</sup> is struck into the Glass as makes it darkish, in one
of the Isles is a square place, on each side y<sup>e</sup> Wall is filled
with y<sup>e</sup> Kings pictures from y<sup>e</sup> Conquest to their present
Majestyes; there is also one Picture pretty Large of a Saxon
King in his Robes and an abbott with his brethren, petitioning
to build this Cathedrall which before belonged to y<sup>e</sup> Isle
of Ely where was y<sup>e</sup> Bishops see. There is also one large
Picture of another Bishop petitioning King Harry y<sup>e</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> to
ffinish and paint y<sup>e</sup> Church. On y<sup>e</sup> other side the wall is
filled up w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> severall abbots and Bishops since ye
Conquest that have been of Chichester. In their advancement
they are brought from Bristol to Chichester and next
advance is to Ely and so on to greater revenues. The tower
is 260 odd steps, from whence you may see the whole town.
There are 3 or 4 good New houses, one is y<sup>e</sup> Dean’s, Mr Edds,
a very good man; from thence I saw y<sup>e</sup> Isle of Wight, Spitthead;
the sea comes within a mile of ye Citty, Remarkable
for Lobsters and Crabs Chichester is. There is an Engine
or Mill about a Mile off the town draws up salt water at one
side from the sea and fresh water from a Little rivulet w<sup>ch</sup>
descends from a hill, and so supply’s y<sup>e</sup> town. Halfe way off
y<sup>e</sup> tower you go round y<sup>e</sup> quire and Looke down into it, there
are severall effigies of marble and allabaster of y<sup>e</sup> Bishops of
the place and one of the Earle of Arundell and his Lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>Chichester is 50 mile from London y<sup>e</sup> Direct way by
Guildford, but I went through more of Sussex w<sup>ch</sup> is much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in blind dark Lanes and up and down Steepe hills, to Billinghurst
and passed through Arundell parke belonging to y<sup>e</sup>
Duke of Norfolke, this was 18 mile, from whence I went to
Dorken in Surry 15 mile, where are y<sup>e</sup> best trouts in y<sup>e</sup>
river w<sup>ch</sup> runns by Box hill a Remarkable diversion to
people that go to Epsum. The hill is full of box w<sup>ch</sup> is
Cutt out in severall walks shady and pleasant to walk in
tho’ the Smell is not very agreeable; the brow of the hill
being Such a height gives a Large prospect of a ffruitfull
vale full of inclosures and woods, and this River Runns
twining itself about and is called y<sup>e</sup> Swallow, and Just about
Dorken and Leatherhead 4 mile thence it sinkes away in
many places w<sup>ch</sup> they call Swallow holes, this Must be some
quicksand, but y<sup>e</sup> Report of it is it sincks here and runnes
und<sup>r</sup> ground a Mile or two and rises about Moles and Runs
againe. Camden does credit this and repeates a tryal one
made of forceing a Duck into one of those falls w<sup>ch</sup> Came out
at y<sup>e</sup> other side by Moles w<sup>th</sup> its ffeathers allmost all Rubbed
off w<sup>ch</sup> supposses y<sup>e</sup> passage to be streight, but how they
Could force y<sup>e</sup> Duck into so difficult a way or whither anything
of this is more than Conjecture must be Left to every
ones Liberty to judge. From Dorken its 10 mile to Kingsston,
a Chalky hard Road w<sup>ch</sup> is in Surrey, this stands on
the Thames, its a great Market for Corne; I was there on
Satturday and saw great quantity’s of Corn and Mault sold;
thence I passed by Richmond park wall a good way and
Came in sight of Hampton Court w<sup>ch</sup> is a Noble Building,
had the good queen Mary Lived to have ffinished it, it would
have been y<sup>e</sup> noblest palace in y<sup>e</sup> Kingdom. I passed the
end of Wanstead and Clapham and part of Lambeth having
Chealsey College in view and y<sup>e</sup> whole Cittys of Westminster
and London so thro’ Southwarke over London bridge into
Middlesex 10 mile in all from Kingston—this Little journey
was 220 mile.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another journey into Herrifordshire from London, by
Uxbridge to Islip 5 miles that is 7 mile off Oxford, from
Islip to Woodstock where remaines no foote steps of faire
Rosomonds Bower, only y<sup>e</sup> walls round y<sup>e</sup> parke and the
little brookes that supply’d it w<sup>th</sup> water for y<sup>e</sup> baths and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>wells and ponds. Thence to Morton Hindmost in Glocestershire
to a Relations house, My Uncle Rich<sup>d</sup> ffiennes’s
widdow, a little neate stone built town, good Innes for y<sup>e</sup>
travellers being y<sup>e</sup> road from London to Worcester and
Herrifford and wales. Thence over Broadway hill to
Parshur in all 30 mile by 12 of y<sup>e</sup> Clock, thence to Upton,
where we pass on a large bridge over y<sup>e</sup> fine River the
Severn w<sup>ch</sup> runs from Worcester and to Glocester, Shrewsbury
and to Bristol where it runns into the sea—in some
places its very broad, Some Miles over, but here it was no
broader than y<sup>e</sup> Thames is at Staines—it affords good ffish,
Salmon and severall sorts besides. I think this River does
not Ebb and flow so farre into y<sup>e</sup> Land. Here we Enter
into Worcestershire and ascend Manborn hills or as some
term them y<sup>e</sup> English Alps, a Ridge of hills Divideing
Worcestershire and Heriforshire and was formerly Esteemed
the divideing England and Wales, Herriford Shropshire &amp;c.
were Weltch Countys. They are at least 2 or 3 miles up
and are in a Pirramidy fashion on y<sup>e</sup> top. I rode up upon y<sup>e</sup>
top of one of y<sup>e</sup> highest from whence Could discern the
Country above 40 miles round and noe hills but what
appeared Like Burrows or Mole hills, these being so high
Nothing Could Limitt y<sup>e</sup> Eye but distance. Just at y<sup>e</sup> Bottom
stands Worcester town which Looks like a Large well built
town of Brick and Stone—I was not in it. On the one Side
of this high Ridge of hills Lies Worcester: Oxford Glocestershire
&amp;c. appears in plaines, enclosures, Woods and Rivers
and many Great hills tho’ to this they appeare Low: on
the other Side is Herriforshire w<sup>ch</sup> appears Like a Country
off Gardens and Orchards the whole Country being very full
of fruite trees &amp;c. it lookes like nothing else—the apple and
pear trees &amp;c. are so thick even in their Corn fields and
hedgerows. The descent is as long and steep in some places
as its riseing was. Thence to a Relations house my uncle
John ffiennes and his son; New house, 20 mile from Parshur
which I rode all in one day in June and y<sup>e</sup> miles are here
very long so that at Least it may be esteemed the Last 20
mile as long as the 30 mile gone in the morning. My Cos’n
ffiennes has made a very convenient habitation at this place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>w<sup>ch</sup> Contrary to its Name was an old built house—Timber
worke, but by his alteration and additions of good Brick
walls round the Court and 4 pretty gardens, w<sup>th</sup> good
Walks grass platts much good fruite, of w<sup>ch</sup> the Country does
Easily produce, and if persons are Curious in planting may
have y<sup>e</sup> best w<sup>ch</sup> my Cosen has here, and the walls some
Lower than other gives the sight of y<sup>e</sup> Garden at one view.
Severall large orchards behind the house with new Stables
and offices w<sup>ch</sup> makes it look well. Itts in sight of severall
houses, but all old buildings—Lady Hopton’s in a Low
meadow—there are woods by it and a Little river parts
them, called y<sup>e</sup> Framy w<sup>ch</sup> gives Name to Severall Little
villages as Cannon froom, Bishops ffroom, Castle froom;
this runnes into another Little river Called the Lug and both
runnes into the River Wye w<sup>ch</sup> is on y<sup>e</sup> back side of Herriford
town. This was 7 miles from us, its a pretty little town
of timber buildings, the streetes are well pitched and handsome
as to breadth and Length. The river Wye is as
broad as the Thames is at Maidenhead bridge, or hardly so
broad, its a Rapid River and seemed much disturb’d; there
is very good ffish in it; it did not looke Cleare w<sup>n</sup> I saw it,
but was thick and yellow but y<sup>t</sup> is against foul weather.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Mount which is the only thing of y<sup>e</sup> Castle that
remaines Commands the sight of y<sup>e</sup> river and town. The
Cathedrall is very neate but small, the Carving of the wood
in the Quire was good. In the Library I was shown by y<sup>e</sup>
Dean of Herriford y<sup>e</sup> History of pope Joan with her Picture,
it was printed in and with the history of all the popes in
Rome successively—it was writt in old English, but I made
a shift to read it. There is ye Bishops Palace and y<sup>e</sup>
Deanes and Doctors houses w<sup>ch</sup> are the best buildings, but
they are not very ffine or Large. 7 mile thence on a flatt is
M<sup>r</sup> Paul folie’s Seate called Stoake in whose parlour you
see Herriford quite plainer—its a very good old house of
Timber worke but old ffashion’d, and good Roome for
Gardens, but all in an old fform and mode and M<sup>r</sup> Folie
Intends to make both a new house and gardens. The latter
I saw staked out, so it will be to no purpose to say anything
of it as its now only y<sup>e</sup> good Barns and Stables that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>are new Covered w<sup>th</sup> slate, y<sup>e</sup> ffine Bowling-green walled in,
and a Summer-house in it all new. There is beyond this,
ffine woods and a delicate Parke above the house—pailed
in; y<sup>t</sup> is stored with deare both red and ffallow and affords
12 brace in a season, there are also fine Coppices.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence to Newhouse againe 7 mile, hither we went
5 or 6 tymes from Newhouse to Broughton. We went by
Eshum and y<sup>e</sup> Vale of y<sup>e</sup> Red horse being a Vale of a great
extent, the earth is all Red, its a very Rich Country for
Corn and ffruites and woods. Its Called y<sup>e</sup> Vale of Eshum
or of y<sup>e</sup> Red horse from a Red horse Cut out on some of y<sup>e</sup>
hills about it and y<sup>e</sup> Earth all Looking Red, y<sup>e</sup> horse
Lookes so as y<sup>t</sup> of y<sup>e</sup> white horse Vale. Here is all very
heavy way to Weston 25 mile in Glocester, to a Parsonage
of my Cos’n Pheramus ffiennes given him for his life by his
and our Grandfather Will<sup>m</sup> Lord Viscount Say and Seale—its
a neate building all stone, and y<sup>e</sup> walls round Court,
Gardens and yards, all are of Stone.</p>

<p class='c012'>A mile thence was one of his sisters marry’d to a Parson
M<sup>r</sup> Browne that has a very neate and Convenient Little
house and Gardens. A mile from thence is a very high hill
from whence I Could see a great distance—Warwick and
Coventry and a large tract of Land all round. Att the
foote of this hill Lyes Camden Town w<sup>ch</sup> I went through,
its built all of stone as is the Church w<sup>th</sup> the Effigie of the
Little Viscountess Camden that lived to a great age and
was Mother to the Earle of Gainsborough; its Cut out in
white Marble and stands in an arch in the wall, w<sup>th</sup> two
Leav’d doores to it, to keep it from y<sup>e</sup> dust—there were
severall little Monuments besides in the Church. From
thence to Brailes and thence to Broughton 19 miles to my
Brother Say, w<sup>ch</sup> is 50 miles from London; I went by
Alsbury 20 thence 30 to London.</p>

<p class='c012'>A journey I went into the New fforest in Hampshire to
Ffarnum 38 mile, there we go by Aberstone the Duke of
Boltons house, stands on y<sup>e</sup> Side of a hill where are ffine
Gardens and much ffruite. From Ffernum you see the Castle
w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> Bishops of Winchesters house, its a large building;
thence you go to Alton 7 mile, thence to Alsford 7 mile more,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>you go along on the hills in sight of the River all w<sup>ch</sup>
gives name to those places, its a good Chaulkey way.
Thence to Winchester 7 mile—in one mile off the town
is Woolsey y<sup>t</sup> was formerly y<sup>e</sup> Bishops house, a large
Rambling building like a little town, this is on Maudline
hill whereon a Considerable ffaire is kept neare Michelmas,
y<sup>e</sup> Traffique mostly hopps which y<sup>t</sup> Country produceth good
and Cheese—its noted for a vast many of Waines from
Severall parts especially from the West Country.</p>

<p class='c012'>Winchester is a large town was once y<sup>e</sup> metropolis, there
is a wall Encompassing it with severall Gates; the streetes
are pretty good, Large and long, y<sup>e</sup> buildings but Low and
old, only some few in the Close w<sup>ch</sup> are new built of the
Doctors houses by y<sup>e</sup> Colledge and the Church. Y<sup>e</sup> Deans
house is a good old house, timber buildings; there are some
of the roomes Lofty and large, a dineing, drawing room and
bed Chamber very good; a long Gallery runns through the
house and opens into the Garden by a Descent of Severall
Stone stepps. Y<sup>e</sup> Garden is but small—there are Green
and gravel walkes higher and Lower, but its all in an old
fashion’d form but neately kept and severall Curiosityes in
potts of flowers and greens. The Bishops palace stands in
a Low Ground or Watry Meadow, its a timber building but
so unpleasant that the Bishop lives not at it but at Ffarly
Castle about 20 mile off.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Cathedrall at Winchester is one of y<sup>e</sup> biggest in
England and is to be admired for its Largeness, not its
neatness or Curiosity, there is an ascent of 20 steps up to
the quire that is finely Carved in y<sup>e</sup> wood, and on the top
all round stands in ffine painted Chests the bones of the
Kings of England y<sup>t</sup> were buried there; for Winchester
was the Regal Citty w<sup>ch</sup> now it has lost, as also a peculiar
art of dying y<sup>e</sup> best purples. In the Church there are no
good Monuments worth notice, the body of the Church is
very large, y<sup>e</sup> Steeple Lookes Noble, but y<sup>e</sup> Spire is not a
neare so high as Salisbury. In the town is a new building
begun by K. Charles the Second for a Palace when he
Came to hunt and for aire and diversions in the Country.
I saw y<sup>e</sup> Modell of it w<sup>ch</sup> was very fine and so would it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>have been if ffinished; but there is only y<sup>e</sup> outside shell is
set up, there were designed fine apartm<sup>ts</sup> and two Chapples
but its never like to be finish’d now.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a good river runns thro’ the town, at y<sup>e</sup> backside
the Castle stood high, but there now remaines only y<sup>e</sup>
ruined walls and banks on w<sup>ch</sup> they make gardens and hopp
yards, w<sup>ch</sup> runnes a great Length on the side of y<sup>e</sup> brow of
the hill that some part of y<sup>e</sup> town is built on—it Lookes
pretty. Here is a good Colledge it is on y<sup>e</sup> same foundation
y<sup>t</sup> New Colledge in Oxford are; both built and
Endowed by Great Will<sup>m</sup> of Wickam an ancester of y<sup>e</sup>
ffiennes and Lord Say and Seale. So all the founders
Kindred by his own Statutes are first to be Chosen and
have a Right to many priviledges—its only in default or
want of any of his Kindred or of Such and Such Parishes w<sup>ch</sup>
he names that any other person ought or Can be Chosen a
Child of this Colledg. They have such a Number above 100—they
have their Diet and a gown every year, and so much
mony Every quarter, and here they have their Learning and
provision.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are also fellowships—w<sup>ch</sup> as they become vacant
they who are fitt its bestowed on them—on w<sup>ch</sup> a young
Man May Maintain himself well and so improve his Learning.
These fellowships at New Colledg are forfeited if they
do not live there, or for y<sup>e</sup> most part; and also as soone as
they are Marryed they are put out in number fellows and
master and warden, but at winchester the fellowships are
of greater value and do appertaine to a person during Life
in Case he Comes and resides for y<sup>e</sup> most part there, even
when they are marryed.</p>

<p class='c012'>I thinke there are but 7 fellowships here. There is a
warden of y<sup>e</sup> Colledge and a Schoolemaster and usher at
Winchester. Y<sup>e</sup> Colledge is a good Pile of Building there
is a very pretty Chapple in it and a very fine Library w<sup>ch</sup> is
in y<sup>e</sup> Cloysters y<sup>t</sup> are very good for walking.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a large hall they eate in and have their exact
Commons to Every one, so have the fellows, their Lodgings
are Convenient and all their offices, the Warden has built a
new appartment for himself w<sup>ch</sup> looks well about a mile or two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>beyond Winchester, we go by S<sup>t</sup> Cross, a Large hospitall
for old men and I thinke most is for y<sup>e</sup> decayed schollars.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Masters place is worth 1000 pound a yeare—it used
to be annexed to y<sup>e</sup> Warden of the Colledges place, by
their ffoundation they are to give reliefe to any Travellers
that call there so farre as a Loafe of bread as big as our
two penny bread is and a Draught of beare and a piece of
mony. I thinke its y<sup>e</sup> value of a Groate. Ffrom thence I
came to Redbridge, thence to Buckland in the new forest in
all 20 mile; ffrom Buckland w<sup>ch</sup> was a Relation’s house—S<sup>r</sup>
Rob<sup>t</sup> Smiths—its a mile to Limington a seaport town—it
has some few small shipps belongs to it and some Little
trade, but y<sup>e</sup> Greatest trade is by their Salterns. Y<sup>e</sup> Sea
water they draw into Trenches and so into Severall ponds
y<sup>t</sup> are secured in y<sup>e</sup> bottom to retain it, and it stands for y<sup>e</sup>
Sun to Exhale y<sup>e</sup> Watry fresh part of it, and if it prove a
drye sumer they make the best and most Salt, for y<sup>e</sup> raine
spoyles y<sup>e</sup> ponds by weakning y<sup>e</sup> Salt. When they think
its fit to boyle they draw off the water from y<sup>e</sup> ponds by
pipes w<sup>ch</sup> Conveys it into a house full of Large Square Iron
and Copper panns; they are shallow but they are a yard or
two if not more Square, these are fixed in Rowes one by
another it may be twenty on a Side, in a house under which
is the ffurnace y<sup>t</sup> burns fiercely to keepe these panns boyling
apace, and as it Candy’s about y<sup>e</sup> Edges or bottom so they
Shovell it up and fill it in great Baskets and so the thinner
part runns through on Moulds they set to Catch it, w<sup>ch</sup>
they Call Salt Cakes. Y<sup>e</sup> rest in y<sup>e</sup> Baskets drye and is
very good Salt and as fast as they Shovell out the boyling
Salt out of y<sup>e</sup> panns they do replenish it w<sup>th</sup> more of their
Salt water in their pipes. They told me when the Season
was drye and so the Salt water in its prime they Could
make 60 quarters of Salt in one of those panns w<sup>ch</sup> they
Constantly attend Night and day all the while the fire is in
the ffurnace, because it would burn to waste and Spoyle y<sup>e</sup>
panns w<sup>ch</sup> by their Constant Use wants often to be repaired.
They Leave off Satterday Night and let out y<sup>e</sup> fire and so
begin and kindle their fire Monday Morning. Its a pretty
Charge to light the fire. Their Season for makeing Salt is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>not above 4 or 5 Months in y<sup>e</sup> year and y<sup>t</sup> only in a dry
Summer. These houses have above 20 some 30 others
more of these panns in them, they are Made of Copper.
They are very Carefull to keep their ponds well secured
and Mended by good Clay and Gravell in the bottom and
Sides and so by sluces they fill them out of the sea at high-tides
and so Conveyed from pond to pond till fit to boyle.
Ffrom Limmington to Lindhurst is 6 mile, where is a house
of y<sup>e</sup> Kings w<sup>n</sup> he comes to hunt in the new fforest, and y<sup>e</sup>
Lord Warden of the fforest is there when he Comes to hunt
and Hawk, to Whome Comes all the Gentry of the Country
to waite on him—he dines at Night from 7 to 12 of the
Clock. He is served in plaite, those y<sup>t</sup> hunt with him all
day Comes and Dines or Supps with him. He has power
to dispose and order y<sup>e</sup> Concerns of y<sup>e</sup> forrest for y<sup>e</sup> timber
for shipps and to have it Cherrish’d and secured from
Spoyle, as also the deare and Game to be preserved, y<sup>e</sup>
disposeing of the Lodges are in his power. There are
15 Lodges and these are disposed to Gentlemen that have
underkeepers y<sup>t</sup> takes care of it, and w<sup>t</sup> is peculiar to y<sup>e</sup>
New forrest and known no where Else are these Brouce
Deare; at these severall Lodges y<sup>e</sup> Keepers gather Brome
and at Certaine tymes in y<sup>e</sup> day by a Call gathers all the
Dear in within the railes which belongs to Each Lodge, and
so they Come up and feed upon this Brouce and are by that
meanes very fatt and very tame, so as to Come quite to
Eate out of y<sup>e</sup> hand. All the day besides they range about
and if they meete anybody if it be their own keeper without
y<sup>e</sup> pail of y<sup>e</sup> Lodge they will run from him as wild as Can
be. These Lodges are about 4 miles asunder and its a
great Priviledge and advantage to be a Cheefe Keeper of
any of these Lodges; they have Venison as much as they
please and Can easily shoote it when the troop Comes up
w<sup>th</sup> in y<sup>e</sup> paile, for none are allowed to Shoot out in y<sup>e</sup>
forrest, nor are allowed to go out w<sup>th</sup> Gun or dog or to keep
any Except Gentlemen, and not they if they have been
found Shooteing in y<sup>e</sup> fforest. I think its ffellony for any
to kill y<sup>e</sup> Kings dear. there are severall Rangers of y<sup>e</sup> fforest,
and 6 verderers y<sup>t</sup> are their justices or judges of all matters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Relateing to y<sup>e</sup> fforest, these ought allwayes to reside in y<sup>e</sup>
fforest and are to attend the King when he Comes into y<sup>e</sup>
new fforest. Clothed in green, they have a buck and Doe
Every year for their ffee, besides being Masters—the under
keepers are at their beck so y<sup>t</sup> they Can get as Much
venison as they want. There is also a Rider of y<sup>e</sup> fforest
who is to see about y<sup>t</sup> all things are secure and well done
and y<sup>e</sup> Timber kept and Deer, to see they are not spoyled
or Destroyed: his Right is to all the Deer y<sup>t</sup> are hurt or
Maimed as also he is to have y<sup>e</sup> Shoulder of y<sup>e</sup> first Stagg
that is hunted and killed in the Season. There is a Bow
man w<sup>ch</sup> is to provide y<sup>e</sup> King w<sup>th</sup> Bow and arrow when he
Comes into y<sup>e</sup> fforest—they have some priviledge also but y<sup>e</sup>
shooteing by bow and arrow being Left off, y<sup>t</sup> office is not
regarded.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom Lindhurst about a Mile is a parke called new
parke enclosed out of y<sup>e</sup> fforrest with Pailes, it belongs to y<sup>e</sup>
Kings house; there is a house in it w<sup>ch</sup> was the Lodge—a
large old Timber house. Ffrom Limington to y<sup>e</sup> Isle of
Wight its about 4 Leagues; to Yarmouth you go by
Hurst Castle, y<sup>t</sup> runnes on a point of land into y<sup>e</sup> sea just
by the Needles within a League of Yarmouth, and those
needles are severall Great Rocks on y<sup>t</sup> side of the Island,
craggy, and severall stand out into the sea w<sup>ch</sup> makes it
very hazardous for shipps to pass there, Especially in a
Storme or for Strangers—y<sup>e</sup> passage being narrow between
the Needles and Hurst Castle, Can easily Command any
ship that would pass there. Yarmouth is a little Sea-port
and has a Little Castle that Can annoy Any Enemy that
should pass by Hurst, so between them may well Secure y<sup>t</sup>
part of y<sup>e</sup> Isle and all on y<sup>e</sup> back side of the jsland are
those Needles y<sup>t</sup> are a Natural ffortification it being inaccessible.</p>

<p class='c012'>So at another part of y<sup>e</sup> jsle there is Sandumffort w<sup>ch</sup> is
a pretty strong place. Y<sup>e</sup> jsland is 10 mile in the breadth
and 30 mile in Length—Upon Most of the high hills you see
the wall of y<sup>e</sup> sea on both Sides, if not all round you as in
some places. Ffrom Yarmouth to Newport is seven mile,
a little town y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Arm of the Sea Comes up to—its one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>the biggest towns in y<sup>e</sup> Island; in a mile off it is Casbrooke
Castle into w<sup>ch</sup> King Charles y<sup>e</sup> first retired when he was
worsted by y<sup>e</sup> Parliaments forces—there are some good
roomes still that remaine but y<sup>e</sup> most part are destroyed
and only ruined walls to be seen. There is a deep well of
40 ffathom they draw up y<sup>e</sup> bucket by a great Wheele in
w<sup>ch</sup> they put a horse or ass—a stone thrown down sounds a
long tyme ere you hear it splash into y<sup>e</sup> water. About
seven miles thence is Cowes both East and west 2 ports for
Shipps to ride in and be Recruited w<sup>th</sup> all sorts of provisions
w<sup>ch</sup> is done on very reasonable terms. Y<sup>e</sup> ffertillity of the
whole jsland produces Corn of all sorts in great plenty, and
all sorts of Cattle and butter; Cheese as also Great Store
of ffish and ffowle; there is some Little part fforrest land
but for y<sup>e</sup> most part are Meddows and good downs.</p>

<p class='c012'>The little ports are all fitted for y<sup>e</sup> Seamen and their
affaires, Little houses, not but there are severall good old
houses that are Gentlemens seats, as S<sup>r</sup> Robert Dilington
at Knighton and S<sup>r</sup> John oglander at Nunwell, S<sup>r</sup> Robert
Worstly and severall More. S<sup>r</sup> Rob<sup>t</sup> Holmes has a good
Estate there, he was the Governour of y<sup>e</sup> Island and of
Yarmouth Castle and there he is buried, Where is his Statue
Cutt in Length in white Marble in the Church and railed in
with Iron Grates; he was raised from Nothing and an
imperious Govern<sup>r</sup>, and what he Scrap’d together was forced
to Leave to his Nephew and base Daughter, haveing no
other, and they have set up this Stately monument which
Cost a Great deal. There is one place called Mottstone
just by the sea side, the Name Comes from many Great
Stones that stand up in the Grounds not unlike y<sup>e</sup> stones at
Stonidge in Wiltshire, but this sort of stone is in Many
places of y<sup>e</sup> Island and most of the houses are built of
Stone, some few Brick. From a hill just above Cowes that
runns along by the Sea side You May Easily see Spitthead
And S<sup>t</sup> Hellens point and all the Shipps that Lay along y<sup>e</sup>
Road and that Lay in Portsmouth haven. From Ride is 3
Leagues to portsmouth, I pass’d it in an hour. Portsmouth
is a very Good town, Well built with Stone and brick, its
not a large town, there are Walls and Gates about it, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>at Least eight Bridges and Gates without one another w<sup>th</sup>
Ditches which secures it very Strongly to y<sup>e</sup> Land-ward, to
the Sea the ffortifications are not so strong; there is a
plattform with Guns and Pallisadoes. There is a good dock
for Building Shipps, but about 6 mile off at Red bridge are
the best Shipps built. There are most of the great Shipps
Lye at Anchor here.</p>

<p class='c012'>I was a board y<sup>e</sup> Royal Charles, and the Royal James,
which are ffine Shipps, y<sup>e</sup> Roomes Spacious for Length and
Breadth but not high. There was a large Chappel and
Cabbin with Damaske furniture. The Castle at Portsmouth
is not Great—its Rather Called the Kings house
where is a Great deal of armes. I was in the Dineing
Roome where King Charles y<sup>e</sup> Second met Queen Katherine
and was marryed to her and set the crown on her head.
There from that roome out of double doores goes a long
wooden bridge to the Plattforme; just by is South sea
Castle which is wash’d round by y<sup>e</sup> sea and pretty deep
water att Spring tides, it Looks very fine but think its but
of Little Strength or Service. Above the town is a very
fine down Called Porchester down very pleasant for Sports
Hawking and hunting; 6 mile over this down is Southwicke,
Coll: Nortons a good old house Capable of being
Made ffine, Large Garden room—Woods and Grounds
Lying well about it and a good Warren, Coppices and y<sup>e</sup>
Stately G<sup>t</sup> Timber trees as may be seen. He was an old
officer in the Long parliam<sup>t</sup> service—this is 15 mile from
Winchester and from Winchester to South-hampton is ten
miles; that is a very neate clean town and the Streets well
pitch’d and kept so, by their Carrying all their Carriages on
Sleds as they do in holland, and permit no Cart to go about
in y<sup>e</sup> town, and keep it Clean Swept—this was formerly
more strictly observ’d when the town was full of trade, for
it is a good port, but now y<sup>e</sup> trade has failed and y<sup>e</sup> town
almost forsooke and neglected. Its a place of No Strength
now, by reason of y<sup>e</sup> Castle being ruined and the fortifications
neglected and the Gunns taken thence, tho’ by most
its thought the best scittuated port for Shipps to Ride and
take their provision in and so Capable of tradeing; but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>last 2 Reignes for near 40 year discourag’d it being a proper
place for the french to have Seiz’d and Secured for themselves.
About 3 Leagues off is Cashot Castle just out into
the Sea w<sup>ch</sup> does Encompasse it all but a very little point
of land Called Horsy Beach that runnes out into the New
forrest by Bewly w<sup>ch</sup> was an abby in the fforest, for
the Extent of y<sup>e</sup> fforrest is large—Miles long; All round
Casholt Castle on the Beach itts as full of fine Cockle shells
so that they heap them up all round the Castle Like a wall.</p>

<p class='c012'>It was at South-hampton King Philip Landed when he
Came to marry Queen Mary. Ffrom thence its 6 miles to
Rumsey, and the Road Runns just by a ffine house of one
of my Relations S<sup>r</sup> John S<sup>t</sup> Barbe’s; the Rows of trees in
the avenues runns just from y<sup>e</sup> Road to the front of the
house. You Enter a Court thats wall’d in and blew Iron
gates. The Court has a Round in the Middle rail’d in,
designed for a Bowling Green, and the Coaches drive
round it to Come to the Entrance w<sup>ch</sup> is severall stone
Stepps to a broad Space that is railed w<sup>th</sup> Balls and
Banisters: the Space is paved w<sup>th</sup> broad free stone the
stepps y<sup>e</sup> Same 8 or 10. The house is a halfe Roman H.
Y<sup>e</sup> hall is in the Middle w<sup>th</sup> double doores, its very lofty
and large there’s a Chimney just against the Entrance on
the Right hand, runns in an Entry through the house to
the back yard, where are the offices, Still house and Barnes
and Coach houses and a very ffine Stable built of Brick—there
are large partitions. In this Entry you have the
pantry and Cellars and on the other side y<sup>e</sup> Kittchin
Larders and pastry w<sup>ch</sup> is one wing of the house and just
behind the hall is y<sup>e</sup> Servants hall and a Little parlour just
by the pantry and back staires. Then the great hall is
divided in halfe by the Staircase, w<sup>ch</sup> hangs on its own work
not supported of Either Side, to the first half pace and all
the way up without Support, on the one Side they are of
oake, the railes and Banisters are varnished. The halfe
paces are Inlaid w<sup>th</sup> yew wood w<sup>ch</sup> lookes a yellowish Red in
Squaires; they Land on the next Story with a space of
this Inlaid worke of a good Bigness the whole Compass of
y<sup>e</sup> Staircase. The Roofe of the Staires is even w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Roofe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>of y<sup>e</sup> next Story; on the other side of the Staires are severall
Rows of Pillars of wood Painted Like Marble for to walke
between, and you pass quite under the Staires into a Little
Closet, and a little farther into a back yard where is a Bathing
house and other necessarys. There is a screen stands on the
side of the Staires next the Chimney to make that part more
private. Y<sup>e</sup> hall Runns quite through to the Garden where
there is a door w<sup>th</sup> stepps down and so at this door you see
thro’ the house to y<sup>t</sup> back yard I mentioned at y<sup>e</sup> End of the
Entry. The other wing of y<sup>e</sup> house is a large parlour and
drawing Roome, this is out of the hall by the Garden; the hall
is well painted and a Carved Cornish round and pillars on
the wanscoate round the Roome. The parlour is wanscoated
and painted a Cedar Coullour. The next Story you Enter
of this large halfe pace on the Right hand, into a door w<sup>ch</sup>
Leads fore Right to a Balcony, and on the Left hand into a
passage, w<sup>ch</sup> leads to the Chamber over the drawing Roome,
and by it is a Servants Roome Even w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> passage. On
the Right hand is a passage Leads to Another Roome just
over against—open the doores and there is a perfect visto,
so there is the other way and a servants roome even w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
passage; beyond this roome is a back Stair Leads to the
bath, and by y<sup>e</sup> Servants Roome is a large back Staire that
Leads to the Next Story, the Great staires Ending here, and
on the Left hand they lead into a large dineing Roome &amp;c.—then
a drawing Roome and next a bed Chamber w<sup>ch</sup> has a
back doore to the back Staires by y<sup>e</sup> kitchin. These doores
open through to y<sup>e</sup> End one way the best bed Chamber and
quite to the balcony y<sup>e</sup> other side a visto.</p>

<p class='c012'>Within the dineing roome on ye Left hand is a very
Largo bed Chamber w<sup>ch</sup> jndeed is y<sup>e</sup> best—good tapistry
hangings—here is design’d a velvet bed its painted white;
there are very good Pictures; here is a Little back Staires
to y<sup>e</sup> Servants hall. The dineing Roome is wanscoated and
varnish’d the other Roomes nothing done to—that is the
drawing Roome and Chamber. W<sup>th</sup> in there is damaske,
and Camlet beds in y<sup>e</sup> other Roomes, and off these back
Staires by y<sup>e</sup>  Kitchin is a Chamber, anty Roome, dressing
roome, 2 Closets These back staires goe up to the next
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Story y<sup>t</sup> Leads to the roomes over this, and to a long
Gallery that is Window all to the ffront and Leads to all y<sup>e</sup>
Chambers. There is handsome roomes only those at y<sup>e</sup>
Side and End are Garret fashion—between are Servants
roomes and Closets: thence a little pair of Stairs Leads up
to the Gallery and thence up to the Cupilow which is in
the Middle of the house, all Windows round and on y<sup>e</sup> top
has a Gold ball that holds severall Gallons. On each Wing
there are 2 little towers, one has y<sup>e</sup> Clock the other a Sundial,
and on the top two gold balls of a Lesser size. The
Gardens are walled in, some with brest walls, some higher
with flower potts on them; severall places with open grates
to Look through with Stone balls or ffigures on the pillars
each Side the Gates everyway. There is a water house
that by a Wheele Casts up the Water out of y<sup>e</sup> River just by,
and fills y<sup>e</sup> pipes to Serve all y<sup>e</sup> house and to fill y<sup>e</sup> bason
designed in the middle of the Garden w<sup>th</sup> a Spout in the
middle.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Gardens are not finish’d but will be very ffine, w<sup>th</sup>
Large Gates open to y<sup>e</sup> Grounds beyond, some of w<sup>ch</sup> are
planted with trees. Its a fine thing, but doubt its no very
good aire—it stands in a low place near y<sup>e</sup> River, the hills
all round on y<sup>t</sup> Side and y<sup>e</sup> Mold and Soyle is Black and
such as they Cut up for peate. The road from hence to
Salisbury is by White Parish and Joy Church and you
come in Sight of my Lord Coal-rain house that Looks Like
a good Building of Stone, but its just so upon the Great
River that it lookes Like a Little Castle or Shipp. This
river runns to Breamore from Salisbury just by a very fine
Seat of y<sup>e</sup> Lady Brooks which was S<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Doringtons heir.
The house Stands finely to the River a brick building.
You Enter into a Walled Court Soe up 12 Stepps at Least
into a Noble hall: on the Left hand was a parlour, and on
y<sup>e</sup> Right a large drawing roome a Little parlour and Large
Staires up to Severall very handsom Chambers ffurnished
with good Tapistry and damaske and some velvets, w<sup>ch</sup> was
new because the fire had Spoiled most of the goods; but
the house was built just in y<sup>e</sup> same ffigure. The Kitchins
and offices are all under y<sup>e</sup> roomes of State and they go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>down Steps to it Under y<sup>e</sup> Arch of Stepps that ascend to
the hall: out of the drawing roome by Glass doors you
enter the Garden on a terrass and y<sup>t</sup> by Stepps, so to
Severall Walks of Gravel and Grass and to the Gardens,
one below another with Low Walls to give the view all at
once. Here was fine flowers and Greens Dwarfe trees and
oring and Lemon trees in Rows w<sup>th</sup> fruite and flowers at
once and some ripe; they are y<sup>e</sup> first oring trees I ever
Saw. Here are Stately woods and walks. This River
Runns to ffording bridge A Little place, thence to Kingwood,
thence to Christchurch; it turns many Great Mills
and there have been great attempts to make it Navigable
w<sup>ch</sup> would be of Great advantage, but all Charge has been
Lost in it. There is Store of good ffish in it; it runns to
Christchurch and divides the new fforest from Wiltshire,
there is a large Bridge that crosses at Christchurch where
it runns into the Sea. This is 18 miles from Salisbury
20 miles from Newtontony over y<sup>e</sup> down, 6 to Rumsy 4 to
Lockerly two to East Titherly where S<sup>r</sup> ffrancis Rowles
has a fine house and Garden and Groves. One on the
Edge of y<sup>e</sup> hill, all in sight of y<sup>e</sup> Road Looks ffinely of
Scott and Norroway ffirrs in Rows and Looks very well.
In 2 mile of this is Dean w<sup>ch</sup> was S<sup>r</sup> John Evlings, now his
Grandsons Lord Kingston, it seems to be a good Lofty
Building, its woody and very ffruitfull. There is Likewise
a good old seate of M<sup>r</sup> Whiteheads my grandfathers,
Normans Court in West Titherly; its well wooded, good
Gardens, but a very old house; a ffine Grove of ffirrs to y<sup>e</sup>
ffront. This is 7 mile from Newtontony and as much to
Stockbridge w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> Road to London; thence to Sutton
12 miles, thence to Basinstoake 12 mile. Its a Large
town and has a good trade being a Road. A mile thence
is Basin on y<sup>e</sup> Left hand w<sup>ch</sup> was a house of y<sup>e</sup> Duke of
Boltons, but being a Garrison in y<sup>e</sup> Civil warrs was pulled
down and Now only some part remaines, and the Gardens
w<sup>ch</sup> are improved and new walls built: fine fruit and vineyards,
a large parke to it. On y<sup>e</sup> Right hand about a mile
off is Hackwood which is another Seate of y<sup>e</sup> Duke of
Boltons in a pretty parke. It looks very pretty not large.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>Basinstoake Lyes watrish but its on Chalke. A little
further on y<sup>e</sup> Left hand at some distance you see a fine
Seate of S<sup>r</sup> Robert Henleys, it looks Like a little town, its
so large a building, and they say its a noble thing ffinished
and furnish’d very well with good Gardens.</p>

<p class='c012'>To Harfordbridge 8 mile thence to bagshott 8 mile a
heavy sandy way, and y<sup>e</sup> Same from thence to Egam 8 mile;
thence to Staines a mile, where we Cross y<sup>e</sup> Thames on a
bridge and enter Middlesex—thence to London 15 miles.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went to see Hampton Court 10 mile from London; it
looks Like a little town y<sup>e</sup> buildings runn so great a Length
on y<sup>e</sup> ground, Y<sup>e</sup> old buildings and y<sup>e</sup> New part w<sup>ch</sup> King
William and Queen Mary built. Y<sup>e</sup> Queen took Great
delight in it. Y<sup>e</sup> new was but just y<sup>e</sup> shell up and some of
y<sup>e</sup> Roomes of State Ceil’d but nothing ffinished. The
roomes were very Lofty, round a Large Court and all the
appartments intire. The old buildings were on the other
side the prioy Garden: there was the water Gallery that
opened into a ballcony to y<sup>e</sup> water, and was decked with
China and ffine pictures of y<sup>e</sup> Court Ladyes drawn by
Nellor. Beyond this came severall Roomes, and one was
pretty Large, at y<sup>e</sup> four Corners were little roomes like
Closets or drawing roomes, one pannell’d all w<sup>th</sup> jappan,
another w<sup>th</sup> Looking Glass, and two w<sup>th</sup> fine work under
pannells of Glass. There was the queens Bath and a place
to take boat in the house. The Gardens were designed to
be very ffine, Great fountaines and Grass plotts and gravell
walkes, and just against the middle of y<sup>e</sup> house was a very
large fountaine, and beyond it a large Cannal Guarded by
rows of Even trees that runn a good way. There was fine
Carving in the Iron Gates in the Gardens w<sup>th</sup> all sorts of
ffigures, and Iron spikes Round on a breast wall and
severall Rows of trees.</p>

  <h2 class='c018'><i>HERE BEGINS MY NORTHERN JOURNEY IN MAY 1697</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c024'>ffrom London to Amwell Berry in Hartfordshire 19 mile,
thence to Bishops Startford in Essex 13 mile, w<sup>ch</sup> is a very
pretty Neat Market town, a good Church and a delicate
spring of Water w<sup>ch</sup> has a wall built round it, very Sweet
and Cleare water for drinking. There is a little river runns
by the town y<sup>t</sup> feeds severall Mills.</p>
<p class='c012'>Thence we Went to Andlyend 10 miles, a house of y<sup>e</sup>
Earle of Sussex w<sup>ch</sup> makes a Noble appearance Like a town,
so many towers and buildings off stone within a parke w<sup>ch</sup>
is walled round. A good River runs through it, we pass
over the bridge. Its built round 3 Courts, there are 30
great and Little towers on the top, and a great Cupilow in
the Middle. The roomes are Large and Lofty with good
Rich old ffurniture tapistry, but Noe beds in y<sup>t</sup> part we saw.
There are 750 (150?) Roomes in the house.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Cannall in the Midst of the parke Look’d very fine,
its altogether a Stately palace and was built for one of y<sup>e</sup>
Kings. Thence to Little-berry one Mile, where is a house
with abundance of Curiosityes all performed by Clock work
and Such like, w<sup>ch</sup> appears very Strange to the beholders,
but the master was not at home so I saw no more than the
Chaire they Set in when they are Carry’d about. All the
Country is pleasant; between this and Cambridge you go
in sight of so many neate villages w<sup>th</sup> Rows of trees about
them and very neate built Churches—Sometimes 5 or 6 of
these are in view together in 3 or four mile of Each other—Y<sup>e</sup>
Churches are stone-work. We went to Babaram where
was a house of S<sup>r</sup> Rich<sup>d</sup> Bennets in a pleasant parke
prettyly situated, only it is in a Low ground, but y<sup>e</sup> fine
Rows of trees in the severall avenues Came just down to the
Road: thence to Bornbridge 5 mile, thence to Hodmogoge
hills 3 miles, w<sup>ch</sup> looks at a distance Like a long Barn, but
when you approach Near you see it a Great fortification or
Ruines of a Castle, with great trenches one within another,
and all y<sup>e</sup> buildings—there is only a long string of Stables
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to keep y<sup>e</sup> Kings hunting horses. The hill is of a great
height from whence you have a great prospect of y<sup>e</sup> whole
Country and of Cambridge w<sup>ch</sup> is 3 mile off. The town
Lyes in a bottom and Marshy Ground all about it severall
miles w<sup>ch</sup> is Garnish’d with willows; y<sup>e</sup> buildings are old
and Indifferent. the Streetes mostly narrow, (except near
the Market place), w<sup>ch</sup> is pretty spacious—there stands the
University Church. Trinity Colledg is the ffinest, yet not
so Large as Christchurch College in oxford. In the first
Court there is a very ffine ffountaine in the Middle of y<sup>e</sup>
Quadrangle w<sup>th</sup> a Carved top and Dials round—there are
Large Cloysters. The Library runns all y<sup>e</sup> rang of building
at y<sup>e</sup> End and stands on 3 rows of stone pillars; it opens
into the Gardens and walk w<sup>th</sup> 3 Large Gates or doores of
Iron Carv’d very ffine w<sup>th</sup> fflowers and Leaves. The
river runs at y<sup>e</sup> back side of most of y<sup>e</sup> Colleges; they have
fine stone bridges over it and gates that Lead to fine walks;
Y<sup>e</sup> rivers name is Cam.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Library farre exceeds that of Oxford, the Staires
are Wanscoated and very large and Easye ascent, all
of Cedar wood, y<sup>e</sup> room spacious and Lofty paved
w<sup>th</sup> black and white marble, y<sup>e</sup> sides are wanscoated
and decked with all Curious books off Learning, their
Catalogue and their Benefactors. There is two Large
Globes at each End w<sup>th</sup> teliscopes and microscopes and
y<sup>e</sup> finest Carving in wood, in flowers, birds, Leaves,
ffigures of all sorts as I ever saw. There is a large Balcony
opens at the End, very large, all finely painted all over
y<sup>e</sup> history of the New Testament. Its a hundred and twenty
steps to y<sup>e</sup> roofe and supported by noe pillars all Arch
of Stone: You walke on y<sup>e</sup> Arch or Cradle as its term’d.
There is 32 Little windows Cut in Stone just as you
ascend to y<sup>e</sup> Cradle or Arch w<sup>ch</sup> runns on Either side, and
a p<sup>r</sup> of Staires of 8 stepps to every 3 windows w<sup>ch</sup> Lead up
to the Arch; thence you ascend the Leads over all w<sup>ch</sup> are
fine, secured by battlements round, there are 4 large Spires:
at each corner one. On these Leads you May see a vast
Country round.</p>

<p class='c012'>You see Ely-minster and y<sup>e</sup> towers; this is a noble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>building and Stands on so advantagious a ground, and so
Lofty built y<sup>t</sup> its perspicious above y<sup>e</sup> town; this is in Lieu
of y<sup>e</sup> Theatre at Oxford there being none here. St Johns
College Garden is very pleasant for y<sup>e</sup> fine walks both
Close Shady walks and open Rows of trees and quickset
hedges. There is a pretty bowling green with Cut arbours
in the hedges. Queens Colledge is old but a stately and
Lofty building. Claire Hall is very Little but most Exactly
neate in all parts, they have walks w<sup>th</sup> Rows of trees, and
bridges over the river and fine painted Gates into y<sup>e</sup> ffields.
Katherine Hall is new built, the Chapple was not Quite
ffinished; the apartments for y<sup>e</sup> fellows and Gentlemen
Commoners are very ffine, a Large dineing roome, a good
Chamber and good Studdy and this for 8£ a year.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here we are Entertained by some of our Companys
acquaintance. From Cambridge we go just by Peterborough:
we see the Minster and y<sup>e</sup> town, very plaine all
built with Stone. The road is very pleasant to Ffenistanton,
8 miles to Godmanchester, and from thence Huntington 1
mile. We cross the River Lin over a bridge and so Enter
Huntingtonshire. This river goes to Lin in Norfolke its a
very pleasant Country to travel in in y<sup>e</sup> Summer, but after
raines its in Some places deep, but the prospects are
delighting; Little town and good Enclosure w<sup>th</sup> woods and
same of the Country’s. Huntington is but a Small Shire
town; just by it is a house of the Lord Sandwich, y<sup>t</sup> it is
pretty large. We enter a good Lofty hall, in it hangs the
Ship in w<sup>ch</sup> he was lost, that is the representation of it Cut
out in Little and all things Exactly made to it; there is a
good parlour and drawing roome: well proportion’d are y<sup>e</sup>
rooms w<sup>th</sup> good old ffurniture and good Pictures. There is
a Large dineing roome above w<sup>th</sup> good tapistry hangings,
and its Ceil’d w<sup>th</sup> jrish oake Carv’d with points hanging
down like fine ffret worke; this wood no spider will weave
on or endure. There are good bed Chambers with good
furniture and fine pictures; over one of the Chimneys is a
fine picture of Venus were it not too much uncloth’d. The
Gardens and Wilderness and Greenhouse will be very fine
when quite ffinished with the dwarfe trees and gravell walks.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>There is a large fountaine or bason which is to resemble
that in the privy garden at Whitehall, which will ffront the
house.</p>

<p class='c012'>The high terrass walks Look out on the Road. all
this Country is good Land and ffruitfull and much like
Oxfordshire.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom Huntington we came to Shilton 10 mile, and
Came in Sight of a great water on the Right hand about a
mile off w<sup>ch</sup> Looked Like Some Sea it being so high and of
great Length: this is in part of the ffenny Country and is
Called Whitlsome Mer, is 3 mile broad and six long. In
y<sup>e</sup> Midst is a little jsland where a great Store of Wildfowle
breeds, there is no coming near it; in a Mile or two the
ground is all wett and Marshy but there are severall little
Channells runs into it w<sup>ch</sup> by boats people go up to this
place. When you enter the mouth of y<sup>e</sup> Mer it lookes
fformidable and its often very dangerous by reason of
sudden winds that will rise Like Hurricanes in the Mer, but
at other tymes people boate it round the Mer with pleasure.
There is abundance of good ffish in it. This was thought
to have been Sea some tyme agoe and Choak’d up and so
remaines all about it for some miles a ffenny Marshy
Ground for those little Rivers that runns into y<sup>e</sup> Sea some
distance of miles. Thence to Wangfford 2 miles, thence
to Stamfford 5 miles.</p>

<p class='c012'>We pass over a down where is a Cross that directs three
wayes York, London and Oatly, and here we Come in Sight
of a Gentlemans house that stands finely on a hill in a
parke, pretty high with fine groves about it. A little
farther when we are pass’d the water att Wansford we
enter Ruttlandshire w<sup>ch</sup> seems more woody than y<sup>e</sup> others.
Stamfford town is as fine a built town all of stone as may
be seen; its on the side of a hill w<sup>ch</sup> appears very fine in the
approach.</p>

<p class='c012'>Severall very good Churches with high Spires and towers
very ornamentall, its not very Large, but much ffiner than
Cambridge, and in its view has severall good houses. On
the Right hand of Stamfford is a house of M<sup>r</sup> Neals in a
pretty neate parke pailed in; y<sup>e</sup> house not very big but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Lookes well. On the Side of y<sup>e</sup> hill over against Stamfford
and on the Left hand over against the town Stands My
Lord of Exeters Burly house, Eminent for its Curiosity.
The Situation is the finest I ever saw, on the Edge of the
hill and severall Rows of trees of severall acres about it
quite to the Road. It stands in a very fine parke w<sup>ch</sup>
is full of deer and fine Rows of trees. On Either side
a very broad Glide or visto that Lookes finely to y<sup>e</sup>
River and to the adjacent hills, a distance, both with fine
woods. The town of Stamfford appears very fine on the
Left hand and most noble woods on the Right hand.
The house Looks very nobly; y<sup>e</sup> Garden very fine within
one another w<sup>th</sup> Lower and higher walls deck’d with all
Sorts of trees and Greens; very fine Gravell walks and
Grass squaires w<sup>th</sup> Statues and fine Grass walks, dwarfs and
all sorts of Green trees and Curious things: very fine
fountaines, there is one in the middle of the Garden thats
just to y<sup>e</sup> Middle also of the house, that is of an exceeding
great size. There is a fine vineyard, Warren and Groves
w<sup>ch</sup> makes its prospects very delightfull.</p>

<p class='c012'>You enter a large Court walled, thence to a Space of
Ground pretty Large, Encompass’d round w<sup>th</sup> a little wall
of a yard High of free Stone very ffine wrought, on which
are to be Iron railes and spires, that was not ffinish’d nor
the space paved which is design’d to be of broad Stone:
all before the house the little breast wall is in a Compass
Like a halfe Moone.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Sides up to the house are built in roomes for appartments,
you ascend the house by Stone Steps—about 12—that
all turn round; the upper Stepp is at Least 20 foot
steps in Compass; the door you enter is of Iron Carv’d the
ffinest I ever saw all sort of Leaves, flowers, figures, birds,
beasts, wheate in y<sup>e</sup> Carving; very Large y<sup>e</sup> doors are—there
is an Inside doore as Case to it. On the other side of
the house is Such another door that Leads into a Court.
The hall is a noble roome painted ffinely, y<sup>e</sup> walls with
armory and Battles; its Lofty and paved with black and
white Marble. You go thence into parlours, dineing rooms,
drawing roomes and bed Chambers one leading out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>another, at Least 20 that were very Large and Lofty, and
most fine Carving in the Mantlepieces, and very fine paint
in pictures, but they were all Without Garments or very
little, that was the only fault, the immodesty of y<sup>e</sup> Pictures,
Especially in My Lords appartment. This bed Chamber
was ffurnish’d very Rich, the tapistry was all blew Silke and
Rich Gold thread, so that the Gold appeared for y<sup>e</sup> Light
part of all the worke. There was a blew velvet bed with
gold ffringe and very Richly Embroidered, all the Inside
with ovals on the head piece and tester, where the figures
are so finely wrought in Satten stitch it Looks Like painting.
There is also My Ladys appart<sup>t</sup>, Severall roomes very
Richly ffurnished and very ffine tapistry with Silver and
gold in Most; there was at Least 4 velvet beds 2 plaine and
2 figured—Crimson—green—Severall Coullours together in
one; Severall Damaske beds and some tissue beds all
ffinely Embroydered. My Ladys Closet is very ffine, the
wanscoate of the best Jappan, the Cushons very Rich Work:
there is a great deale of fine worke under Glasses and a
Glass case full of all Sorts of Curiosityes of Amber stone
Currall and a world of fine things. My Lord Excetter in
his travells was for all sorts of Curious things if it Cost him
never so much, and a great many of my Ladyes fine things
were given her by her Mother y<sup>e</sup> Countess of Devonshire.
There is a Chamber My Lady used to Lye in in the Winter,
a green velvet bed and the hangings are all Embroydery of
her Mothers work very ffine; the Silk Looks very fresh and
ffigures Look naturall.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a drawing room by that, w<sup>ch</sup> has a great Curiosity
that my Lord brought from beyond sea, on the Mantlepiece
under a glass; its nunns work the ffinest Embroidery
that it Looks just Like point or the ffinest Linnen you can
see; this Cost a great Sume. There are fine Chimney
pieces of Marble and the windows the same, there are at
least 20 rooms very Large and Lofty that are all painted
on the top; there are at Least 20 on y<sup>e</sup> other side of the
house all w<sup>th</sup> different ffrett work on the Ceiling, besides
almost as many more roomes that are a building. Some
the floores Not Laid, others Not ffinish’d y<sup>t</sup> the house will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>be a vast thing w<sup>n</sup> done. The floores were Inlaid in severall
roomes, the Chapple is old and not to abide, the painting is
good but the place is not Suteable to any part Else. The
great variety of the roomes and ffine works tooke me up 2
full hours to go from one Roome to another over the house.
The Bowling-green, Wilderness, nor Walke I was not in,
being so great a tract of ground, but you see it all at a
view on y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup> house; it is Esteemed the ffinest house
and scituation that is in England and will be very Compleate
when ffinish’d.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence we went to Streton 6 mile, a Little house of
one Mr Horsman; very good Plantations of trees about it—Stone
building. Rutlandshire seems more woody and Inclosed
than some others. Thence to Colson where Lincolnshire
Comes in; 2 mile thence towards Lincoln we go on a
fine Champion Country much Like Salisbury plaine, and a
Large prospect all round—at a distance you See woods and
towns. This is the best part of this shire for most part is
ffenny, and we went twenty six Miles all on Such Way
quite to Lincoln town. We pass by Grantum which is a
good town 16 mile from Lincoln, all built with Stone, but
Lies down in a Low bottom. The Church has a very high
Steeple, its Seen above a Great hill that is by it of a great
Length and its a long tyme w<sup>n</sup> you see a great part of the
Steeple before you come to see the Church or town it Lies
so in a bottom. Lincoln opens to view at Least 6 miles
off; it Stands on a very high hill and Looks very ffine; at
the Entrance the houses Stand Compact together. The
Streetes are but Little but its a vast hill to ascend into the
town where the Minster stands, by that Means its very
perspicious and Eminently in view a great Many Miles off.
The tower, that Great Thoms nest, is 250 steps up, 8
persons may very well Stand up in the hollow of the bell
together, its as much as a man Can Reach to the top of the
bell with his hand when he is in the Inside; its rarely Ever
rung but only by Ringing the Clapper to Each Side w<sup>ch</sup> we
did and that sounds all over the town. The houses are but
small and not lofty nor y<sup>e</sup> Streetes of any breadth. The Sea
has formerly Come up to the town and y<sup>re</sup> has been very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>deep water where now great part of y<sup>e</sup> town is built, so y<sup>t</sup>
what was y<sup>e</sup> town formerly is that w<sup>ch</sup> stands upon a precipice
as it were of a hill. Y<sup>e</sup> water is Choake up now and
y<sup>e</sup> sea Comes not near in Severall Miles and what water
they have is Called Lincoln Dike—you pass it over on a
bridge. We went thence by many very ffine Seates, we
pass by S<sup>r</sup> John Brownlows and Severall others; thence to
Newark 12 mile in Nottinghamshire; just by it you see a
very pretty new house of brick building of the Lord Lexingtons,
w<sup>th</sup> the walls and towers that Looks very Well. Newark
is a very neate Stone built town, the Market place is very
Large and Look’d ffine; just by it is the Great Church w<sup>ch</sup> is
Large and with a very high Spire, there is prayers twice a
day in it. There remaines the holes in the Church walls
that the bullets made which were shott into the town in the
Siege Laid to it by the Parliament army in the Civil warrs:
the Castle was then demolish’d so y<sup>t</sup> only the ruinated walls
remaine w<sup>ch</sup> is washed by a very pretty river. At this we
Enter Nottinghamshire and here I met w<sup>th</sup> the strongest
and best Nottingham ale that Looked very pale but Exceeding
Clear. Thence to Nottingham town, its 12 mile
more and we ffery’d over the Trent w<sup>ch</sup> in some places is so
deep, but waggons and horses ffords it. I rode along 7 or 8
mile by the Trent w<sup>ch</sup> is a ffine River tho’ not so broad as
the Thames is at Kingston, but it look’d very pleasant to
Ride by its bancks for so many miles, and on the other side
was a high Ridge of hills shaded over from the top to the
bottom w<sup>th</sup> fine trees and this for Severall Miles. When on
the other hand you see a vast bottom Called Note Vale, y<sup>e</sup>
wood belongs to one M<sup>r</sup> Heckam. You pass by severall
pretty houses by the river Side, Stone buildings, good
Gardens, and a Little farther you see the Lord Kingstons
house w<sup>ch</sup> is Contigeous to Nottingham town, called Home
Peirpoynt w<sup>ch</sup> Looks finely in woods. The town of Nottingham
is the neatest town I have seen, built of stone and
delicate, Large and long Streetes much like London, and y<sup>e</sup>
houses Lofty and well built. The Market place is very
broad, out of w<sup>ch</sup> runns a very Large Streete much like
Holborn but the buildings ffine, and there is a Pyaza all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>along one side of one of the Streetes, w<sup>th</sup> Stone pillars for
walking that runns the Length of the Streetes w<sup>ch</sup> is a mile
long. All the Streetes are of a good size all about y<sup>e</sup> town
and well pitch’d, there are severall good houses in the town.
There are 3 or 4 Large houses of the Duke of New-Castles
w<sup>th</sup> the Castle w<sup>ch</sup> is a fine thing—stands very high on a hill—and
when you Come to the Castle you ascend 40 Steps to the
Court and hall. The roomes are very Lofty and Large, 6 or
7 state roomes and a long gallery hung with fine Pictures of
the ffamily; the wanscoate is most of Cedar. Some Roomes
are hung with good tapistry. The Chamber of State is
hung w<sup>th</sup> very Rich tapistry so much silver and gold in it
that the 3 pieces that hung the Roome Cost 1500<sup>£</sup>: the
bed was rail’d in as y<sup>e</sup> presence Chamber used to be, y<sup>e</sup>
bed was damaske. The floore of the roome was jnlay’d w<sup>th</sup>
Cyphers and the Corronet: here y<sup>e</sup> Princess Ann Lay when
she fled in King James’s tyme when the prince of orange
was Coming over. On the Leads you have a very fine
prospect of y<sup>e</sup> whole town and river; You see the Earle of
Kingstones and S<sup>r</sup> Thomas Willoughby’s fine house on y<sup>e</sup>
other side of y<sup>e</sup> town, and at a distance we see Beavior
Castle the Earle of Rutland’s house, and a prospect more
than 20 mile about, shewing the diversityes of Cultivation
and produce of the Earth. The land is very Rich and
fruitfull, so the Green Meadows w<sup>th</sup> the fine Corrn ffields w<sup>ch</sup>
seemes to bring forth in handfulls. They soe most of Barley
and have great Encrease, there is all sorts of Graine besides,
and plaines and Rivers and Great woods and Little towns
all in view. They make brick and tile by y<sup>e</sup> town—the
Manufacture of the town mostly Consists in weaving of
Stockings w<sup>ch</sup> is a very Ingenious art. There was a man
that spunn glass and made Severall things in glass—birds
and beasts. I spunn some of the glass and saw him make
a swan presently w<sup>th</sup> divers Coull’d glass; he makes
Buttons w<sup>ch</sup> are very strong and will not breake. Nottingham
is ffamous for good ale, so for Cellars, they are all
dugg out of the Rocks and so are very Coole. Att y<sup>e</sup>
Crown Inn is a Cellar of 60 stepps down, all in y<sup>e</sup> Rock
Like arch worke over your head: in y<sup>e</sup> Cellar I dranke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>good ale. We were very well Entertained and very
Reasonably att the Blackmoors head; thence we went to
Mansfield 12 mile and pass’d some part of the fine fforest
of Sherwood. Mansfield is a Little Market town built with
Stone, there is a Little river; they make and dye Tammy’s
here. There is one pretty Stone built house just by the
water side of 40 Stepps ascent into it. At the End of the
town is an hospital built by a quaker for ancient people,
its a good neat building, they were to have 8 pound a year
a piece and the roomes and Gardens, but its Chiefly for their
friends. There is nothing remarkable here but the dearness
of y<sup>e</sup> Inns, tho’ in so plentifull a Country. We went thence
to Wursup and went through a parke of y<sup>e</sup> Duke of New-Castles
and by his house Calld Welbeake. Ye house is
but old and Low buildings, but the parke is the Noblest
wood I Ever saw, fine and stately Straight. A mile thence
is a fine pile of Buildings of Stone very uniforme and high
Called Worsup Mannour built by a Coe heir of the Devonshire
house—3 sisters built 3 noble buildings, this and
Ardeck and Chattsworth. A little beyond this is another
Building the remaines of Worsup Abby. All the way to
Blith is a very heavy Sandy Way 12 miles. At Blith was
a very Sweete house and Gardens and Grounds, it was of
Brick work Coyn’d with Stones and the Windows with
Stone, all sashes; the building was so neate and Exact, it
was Square w<sup>th</sup> 4 juttings out at Each Corner; it Stands
high and Commands the Sight of the Country about. The
fine river by it with fish ponds and Meadows and fine
woods beyond makes it look very pleasant. The Gardens
are very neate and after the London Mode, of Gravel and
Grass walks and Mount, and the Squaires with dwarfes and
Cyprus, ffirre and all sorts of Greens and fruite trees, its
very ffruitefull—I Eate good fruite there. Its just by the
Church so that a Large Arch w<sup>ch</sup> did belong to the Church
is now made a shady Seate to the Garden with Greens over
it, under w<sup>ch</sup> is a Sepulchre for y<sup>e</sup> ffamily. It belongs to
one M<sup>r</sup> Mellish a Merchant in London, its in all parts a
most Compleate thing and its scituation most pleasant.
Almost all y<sup>e</sup> road between this and DonCaster is sandy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>way, to Rosdin 3 mile, thence to DonCaster 6 miles—here
Yorkshire beginns and here the Musick wellcom’d us into
Yorkshire. DonCaster is a pretty Large town of Stone
buildings, the streetes are good, there is a handsome Market
Cross advanc’d on 20 steps at Least. The Church is neate
and pretty Large, Severall Little Monuments. This town
stands on the River Don, w<sup>ch</sup> gives name to the town, here
is also a good Large Meeteing place. We were here the
Lord’s day and well Entertained at the Angel. Thence we
went to Wentbridge and pass’d by woods belonging to S<sup>r</sup>
Wentworth by his house 7 mile to Wentbridge, where had
been a fire the night before Caused by the Lightening and
thunder w<sup>ch</sup> was remarkably great as we took notice of,
2 barnes and a house was burnt.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence we ascended a very Steepe hill and so to Fferrybridge
3 mile where we pass’d the fine River Called the
Aire, Large for Barges as was most of those Rivers I have
mention’d.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence to TodCaster 8 mile, w<sup>ch</sup> is a very good
Little town for travellers, mostly jnns and little tradesmens
houses. This stands on a very large River Called the
Whart. Just before you Come to y<sup>e</sup> town there is some of
y<sup>e</sup> water w<sup>ch</sup> on Great raines are not to be pass’d—it was
very deep when I went through. Thence we go much on a
Causey to Yorke 8 miles more, it stands high but for one of
the Metropolis and the see of y<sup>e</sup> Archbishopp it Makes but
a meane appearance. The Streetes are Narrow and not of
any Length, save one w<sup>ch</sup> you Enter of from the bridge that
is over the Ouise which Lookes like a fine River when full
after much raine. It is but Low in Comparison of Some
Rivers, it bears Great Barges, it Looks muddy, its full of good
ffish. We Eate very good Cod fish and Salmon and that at
a pretty Cheape rate, tho’ we were not in the best jnn for the
Angel is the best in Cunny Streete. The houses are very
Low and as jndifferent as in any Country town and the
Narrowness of y<sup>e</sup> Streetes makes it appear very mean.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nottingham is so farre before it for its size—its true
Nottingham is not a quarter so bigg, Else y<sup>e</sup> Streetes and
buildings are so Much Nobler as Can be jmagin’d; it Lookes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>better att the approach because you see the towers off y<sup>e</sup>
gates and Severall Churches in Compassing y<sup>e</sup> Minster and
all y<sup>e</sup> Windmills round y<sup>e</sup> town of w<sup>ch</sup> there are many. Y<sup>e</sup>
River runns through the town and so its divided, y<sup>e</sup> buildings
Look No better than the outskirts off London Wappen &amp;c.
The Bridg is fine arches and built on with houses; the
Pavements w<sup>ch</sup> is Esteem’d the Chiefe part of town where y<sup>e</sup>
Market house and town hall stands is so mean that Southwarke
is much before it. There are a Great Many pretty
Churches 16 in Number, but the minster is a noble building
and holds in view at Least 30 miles before you Come to it.
I saw it and also at y<sup>t</sup> distance, and saw just by it a high
hill or ffortification it appeared to be, but when I Came to
York I found it to be only a very high hill w<sup>th</sup> stately high
trees on it as thick as Could be, a Noble Grove. The Minster
is very Large and fine of Stone, Carv’d all the outside, 3
high towers above the Leads; I was in one of them, the
highest, and it was 262 steps and those very Steep Steps,
there is a Gallery round the middle of the Church about
halfe way that goes off these steps of the tower, where you
may go round and Looke down into the body of y<sup>e</sup> Church
and y<sup>t</sup> was so great a distance that the men and Ladyes
that were Walking below look’d like Pigmyes a very little
to us above. On the Leads of y<sup>e</sup> tower Shews a vast
prospect of the Country, at Least 30 mile round, you see all
over the town y<sup>t</sup> Lookes as a building too much Cluster’d
together, y<sup>e</sup> Streetes being so narrow—some were pretty
Long. There is another river w<sup>ch</sup> fills the ditches round the
town Called Ffosse. In the Minster there is the Greatest
Curiosity for Windows I ever saw, they are so large and so
Lofty, those in the Quire at y<sup>e</sup> End and on Each side that is
3 storys high and painted very Curious with History of y<sup>e</sup>
Bible; the painting is very fine such as was in Kings
Chapple in Cambridge, but the Loftyness of y<sup>e</sup> windows is
more than I ever saw any Where Else and by all accounts
is peculiar; There is such another Window at the End of the
Cross jsle just by y<sup>e</sup> Quire—all y<sup>e</sup> other Windows are of y<sup>e</sup>
usual Size of other Cathedralls. Ye body of y<sup>e</sup> Church is
large and I thinke Larger than any Cathedrall I have seen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>bigger than Winchester Cathedrall. All these Isles are
broad the people of ffashion use them to Walke in and on
that account its much [something left out] they keep it not
Cleaner, the Quire has a very good Carving in Wood about
it, there is a very good Organ, the table cloth and Cushons
and books at y<sup>e</sup> Comunion table was Crimson velvet and
hangings, and its Embroyder’d very Richly w<sup>th</sup> gold of a
Great depth, and Gold ffringe at y<sup>e</sup> bottom: this was Given
y<sup>e</sup> Church by Doctor Lamplue y<sup>t</sup> was the Arch-bishop
whose Statue is in White Marble in y<sup>e</sup> wall w<sup>th</sup> Mitre and
shepherds Crook. Just by him is ye Effigy of another
Bishop Laying along cut in Stone, and by the aire and Mien
he looks more Like a Soldier or Beau than a Bishop and so
it seemes he was in humour. The Embriodery at the table
is almost yard deep, that was given by Lamplue. In the
vestry there is a well of Sweet spring-water called S<sup>t</sup> Peter’s
well, y<sup>e</sup> S<sup>t</sup> of the Church, so it is S<sup>t</sup> Peters y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall is.
There is a large hunters horne tipt with Silver and Garnish’d
over and Engraved ffinely all double Gilt w<sup>th</sup> a
Chaine, the same given by a Gentleman that also gave his
Estate to add to the revenues of y<sup>e</sup> Church, on a dislike to
disobedient Children; he used the horne When he hunted
and drank in it too. I saw there the ffine tissue Cannopy
that was held over the head of King James the first when
he Came into England and y<sup>e</sup> head of 2 mace w<sup>ch</sup> were
Carry’d before him then. There I saw a Chest that was
Triangular fashion, the Shape of y<sup>e</sup> Coapes when folded in
y<sup>e</sup> Middle and so put into this Chest. The Chapter house
is very finely Carv’d and fine painting on the windows all
round, its all arched Stone and Supported by its own Work
haveing no pillars to Rest on, tho’ its Length and breadth
be Equal and at Least 24 ffoot Each. Here was a mint
for Coyning the old money and plaite into new mill’d
money; I saw them at work and Stamp’d one halfe Crown
my Self—they dispatch worke very fast and have Coyn’d
Severall 1000_£. I see all parts of the work about y<sup>e</sup>
pounding, the boyling, defineing and makeing Barres and
Cutting out in y<sup>e</sup> mill and Bakeing and Stamping, all but
Milling which art they are Sworne to keep private.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span> The Bishops Seate was 4 or 5 mile out of town on the
River Ouise. Ffrom thence we went over a marshy
Comon to the Spaw at Marsborough 12 mile; the town is a
pretty stone building, in it a large Market place; there is a
River, the water Looks black, I ffancy it runns off from
the Iron and sulpher mines which Changes the Coull<sup>r</sup>;—We
pass it over on a large bridge, tho’ in some places they
may ford it, its all on a Rock and the Sides of the hill by
y<sup>e</sup> River is all rock and the Little houses are all built in
the Rocks, there is a little Chapple cut out of the Rock and
arch’d and Carved w<sup>th</sup> ffigures of Saints, I suppose its
Called S<sup>r</sup> Robert Chapple he was Esteemed a very devout
man, his Effigee is Carv’d at the Entrance, there is an alter
y<sup>t</sup> was deck’d w<sup>th</sup> flowers and the Ground w<sup>th</sup> Rushes for y<sup>e</sup>
devout that did frequent it. Severall Papists there about
and many that Came to y<sup>e</sup> Spaw and S<sup>t</sup> Mongers well did
say their prayers there. There was a Manuscript w<sup>th</sup> a
long story of this S<sup>r</sup> Robert. There is also the ruines of
an abbey where there has been many bones taken up and
some preserv’d as Reliques—there was a papist Lady
Lodg’d where we did and our Land Lady at y<sup>e</sup> Inn where
we were treated Civily she told us she went with this Lady
among these ruines where the Lady would say her prayers,
and one day some had been digging and brought up y<sup>e</sup>
bone of a mans arme and hand and y<sup>e</sup> Ligature of y<sup>e</sup>
Elbow held y<sup>e</sup> bones together w<sup>ch</sup> by Strikeing Came
asunder, and in y<sup>e</sup> hollow part of y<sup>e</sup> joynt was a jelly like
blood that was moist, this Lady dipp’d y<sup>e</sup> End of her
handkerchief in it and so Cut it off and put it up as a
Relique. There are y<sup>e</sup> ruinated walls of the Castle
remaines but of no use, but some part is made a prison
and some vaults made Cellars. I dranke very Strong
Clear ale in one of those Cellars.</p>

<p class='c012'>We were in a very pretty Garden of a Gentlemans of our
LandLady Mason’s acquaintance where was all manner
of Curiosityes of fflowers and Greens—Great variety—there
is also a Cherry Garden with Green walkes for y<sup>e</sup> Company
to walk in and a Great Seate in a high tree that gives a
pleasant prospect.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span> From thence we went over to Haragate w<sup>ch</sup> is just by
the Spaw, two mile further over a Common that belongs to
Knarsborough; its all marshy and wett and here in the
Compass of 2 miles is 4 very different springs of water;
there is the Sulpher or Stincking spaw, not Improperly
term’d for the Smell being so very strong and offensive
that I could not force my horse Near the Well; there are
two Wells together with basons in them that the Spring
rises up in, which is ffurr’d with a White Scumm which rises
out of the water, if you keep it in a Cup but a few hours
it will have such a white Scumm on it, not withstanding it
rises out of y<sup>e</sup> Spring very Cleare and so being a quick
Spring itt Soone purges it Self Cleare againe, it Comes
from Brimstone mines, for the taste and smell is much of
Sulpher, tho’ it has an additionall offenciveness Like
Carrion. The Ground is Bitumus or the Like that it runns
over, it has a quality of Changing Silver into y<sup>e</sup> Coull<sup>r</sup> of
Copper and that in a few minutes, much quicker than the
Baths in the West County in Somersetshire. Its a quick
purger and very good for all Scurbutick humours, some
persons drink a quart or two, I dranke a quart in a Morning
for two dayes and hold them to be a good Sort of Purge if
you Can hold y<sup>r</sup> breath so as to drinke them down. Within
a quarter of a mile is the sweete spaw or Chalibiet, a Spring
which rises off Iron and steele like Astrup or Tunbridge
and Like the German Spaw. This is a quick Spring and
the Well made up with a bason, and a Cover of Stone over
it Like an arch; this opperates as all jron springs does,
tho I Could not find them so strong or spiriteous as those
at Tunbridge. One thing I observ’d of the Stinking spaw
tho’ its taste and opperation was like the Somersetshire
bathes, yet this was not warme in the Least as those
Bathes are. Just Between these two spaws is a fine Cleare
and sweete Spring of Comon water very good to wash
Eyes and pleasant to Drinke. The ffourth Spring w<sup>ch</sup> is
but two mile off these is of a petrifying quality turnes all
things into stone. It rises in a banck on y<sup>e</sup> top of a hill
and so runns along in a little Channell about a foote over
and all the Ground it runns over is moorish and full of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>holes with water Standing in it, w<sup>ch</sup> stincks just like the
Sulpher Spaw and will turn Silver to the Coullour of Copper
as y<sup>t</sup> does. Notwithstanding this Clear spring runns
through it with a Swift Current to the brow of y<sup>e</sup> hill and
then it spreads it Self all round y<sup>e</sup> hill w<sup>ch</sup> is a Rock, and
so runns down all over the brow of y<sup>e</sup> hill Continually,
like a Nasty shower of Small and Great Raine, and so it
meetes in y<sup>e</sup> bottom and runns all into the river Knarsborough,
and this water as it runns—where it Lyes in the
hollows of y<sup>e</sup> Rock does turn moss and wood into Stone
or rather Crusts or Candys wood. I saw some w<sup>ch</sup> had a
perfect Shell of stone about it, but they tell me it does in
tyme penetrate through the Wood. I took Moss myself
from thence which is all Crisp’d and perfect Stone; all the
Grass Straws or any thing that the water falls upon it does
Convert to hardness like Stone. Y<sup>e</sup> Whole rock is Continually
dropping with water besides y<sup>e</sup> Showering from
the top w<sup>ch</sup> ever runns and this is Called the dropping well.
There is an arbour and y<sup>e</sup> Company used to Come and
Eat a Supper there in any Evening to have the pleaseing
prospect and the murmuring Shower to Divert their Eare;
in a good Space of tyme it will harden Ribon Like Stone
or any thing Else.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom Harragate to Cockgrave is 6 mile where is a
Spring of exceeding Cold Water Called S<sup>t</sup> Mongers Well;
the Story is of a Child y<sup>t</sup> was Laid out in y<sup>e</sup> Cold for the
parishes Care and when the Church-Wardens found it they
took Care of it—a new born Infant—and when it was
baptised they gave it the Name of “Amongst” because
they said the Child must be kept among them, and as the
papist sayes he was an Ingenious Child and so attained
Learning and was a very religious man and used this spring
to wash himself; after sometymes that he had gotten
prefferrment and so grew Rich he walled the Spring about
and did many Cures on diseased bodies by batheing in it,
w<sup>ch</sup> Caused after his death people to frequent the Well w<sup>ch</sup>
was an Inconveniency to y<sup>e</sup> Owners of y<sup>e</sup> ground, and so
they forbad people Coming and Stopped up y<sup>e</sup> Well; and
the Story sayes on that severall judgments Came on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>owners of y<sup>e</sup> Ground and y<sup>e</sup> Spring broke up all about his
Ground w<sup>ch</sup> forced him to open it againe and render it
usefull to all that would Come to Washe in it—thus farre of
y<sup>e</sup> fable.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now the Spring is in use and a high wall round it, Y<sup>e</sup> Well
is about 4 or 5 Yards square and round the brimm is a
walke of Broad stone round. There are 4 or 5 Steps down
to the bottom, it is no deeper at Some places then a Little
above y<sup>e</sup> Waste, not up to y<sup>e</sup> Shoulders of a woman, and
you may kneel on a flatt Stone and it Comes to y<sup>r</sup> Chin—this
the papists made use of very much. At one Corner the
Springs rise they are very quick and there is a Sluce that it
Continually runns off so as to keep just at the same depth,
and it runns off so fast and y<sup>e</sup> Springs supply so fast that it
Clears the Well presently after any body has been in. I
allwayes Chose to be just where y<sup>e</sup> springs rise that is much
the Coldest and it throws off anything in the Well to y<sup>e</sup>
Sluce. Setting aside y<sup>e</sup> papists ffancyes of it I cannot but
think it is a very good Spring being remarkably Cold and
just at y<sup>e</sup> head of y<sup>e</sup> Spring, so its ffresh w<sup>ch</sup> must needs be
very strengthning; it Shutts up the pores of y<sup>e</sup> body immeadiately,
so fortifyes from Cold, you Cannot bear ye Coldness
of it above 2 or 3 minutes and then you Come out and
walke round y<sup>e</sup> pavement and then in againe, and so 3 or 4
or 6 or 7 as many tymes as you please. You go in and out
in Linnen Garm<sup>ts</sup>, some go in fflannell; I used my bath
Garm<sup>ts</sup> and so pulled them off and put on flannell when I
Came out to go into the bed which is best; but some Came
at a distance—so did I and did not go into bed—but some
will keep on their wet Garments and let them drye to them
and say its more beneficial, but I did not venture it. I
dipp’d my head quite over every tyme I went in and found
it Eased a Great pain I used to have in my head, and I was
not so apt to Catch Cold so much as before w<sup>ch</sup> I imputed
to the Exceeding Coldness of y<sup>e</sup> Spring that shutts up the
pores of the body. Its thought it runns off of some very
Cold spring and from Clay. Some of y<sup>e</sup> papists I saw there
had so much Zeale as to Continue a quarter of an hour on
their knees at their prayers in y<sup>e</sup> Well, but none else Could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>well endure it so long at a tyme, I went in 7 Severall
seasons and 7 tymes Every Season and would have gone in
oftener Could we have Staid longer. We went back to
Harragat 6 mile and then we went to Burrough Bridge 8
mile—a famous place for Salmon, but then we Could not
meete with any, but we had a very Large Codfish there
above a yard long and more than halfe a yard in Compass
very fresh and good and Cost but 8 pence. I saw as big a
one bought then for 6 pence and six Crabbs as big as my
two hands, the Least was bigger than one of my fists, all
cost but 3 pence. Thence to Harragate 8 mile, then we
went and Laid at Knarsburoughe 2 mile, w<sup>ch</sup> was nearer to
S<sup>t</sup> Mungers Well, for we went it twice from Harragate and
back w<sup>ch</sup> was 12 mile more and found it too farre to go in
an afternoon—from Knarsburough it was but 4 mile; we
went it four tymes and back w<sup>ch</sup> was 16 miles and we went
afterwards to Harraget 3 tymes and back 12 mile more.
From Knarsborough we went to Rippon a pretty Little
market town mostly built of Stone, 8 mile, a Large Market
place with a high Cross of severall Stepps; we were there
the Market day where provisions are very plentifull and
Cheape.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Market was sold then 2 good Shoulders of veal,
they were not very fatt nor so large as our meate in London
but good meate, one for 5<sup>d</sup> the other for 6<sup>d</sup>, and a good
quarter of Lamb for 9<sup>d</sup> or 10<sup>d</sup>, and its usual to buy a very
good Shoulder of Veale for 9 pence, and a quarter of Beefe
for 4 shillings; Indeed it is not large ox Beef but good
Middling Beasts: and Craw ffish 2<sup>d</sup> a Doz<sup>n</sup>—so we bought
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Notwithstanding this plenty some of y<sup>e</sup> Inns are very
dear to Strangers that they Can impose on. The town
Stands on a hill and there is a good large Stone built
Church well Carved, they Call it a minster. There is very
fine painting over the alter, it Looks so natural just like
Real Crimson satten with gold ffringe like hangings, and
Severall rows of Pillars in jsles on Either side w<sup>ch</sup> looks very
naturall. There are two good Bridges to the town, one was
a rebuilding, pretty large with Severall arches Called Hewet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>bridge—its often out of repaire by reason of the force of y<sup>e</sup>
water that Swells after great raines, yet I see they made
works of wood on purpose to breake the violence of y<sup>e</sup>
Streame and y<sup>e</sup> Middle arche is very Large and high.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are Severall good houses about y<sup>e</sup> town and Severall
Gentlemens Seates about a mile or two distance: 2 mile off
is a fine place of S<sup>r</sup> Edw<sup>d</sup> Blackets, it looks finely in y<sup>e</sup>
approach in the Midst of a good parke, and a River runns
just by it, it stands in the middle and has two Large
Gardens on Each side. You Enter one through a Large
Iron Barr-gate painted Green and gold tops and Carv’d in
Severall places, this is ffine Gravel walks between grass
plotts 4 Square, with 5 brass Statues Great and Small in
Each square, and full of borders of flowers and Green banks
with flower potts. On y<sup>e</sup> other side of y<sup>e</sup> house is just such
a Garden, only the walkes are all grass rowl’d and the
Squares are full of dwarfe trees, both ffruites and green, set
Cross wayes w<sup>ch</sup> Lookes very finely. There is a flower
Garden behind y<sup>e</sup> house; in it and beyond it a Landry
Close, with frames for drying of Cloths, walled in. There
are good Stables and Coach house and all the offices are very
Convenient—very good Cellars all arch’d, and there I
dranke small beer four years old not too Stale, very Clear
good Beer well brew’d. Their kitching, pastry and pantry
&amp;c all very Convenient; in y<sup>e</sup> pantry hangs a picture of y<sup>e</sup>
dimentions of a large ox y<sup>t</sup> was fed in these grounds w<sup>th</sup>
y<sup>e</sup> accò of its weight. Y<sup>e</sup> Quarters was 106 Stone 1<sup>£</sup> and
y<sup>e</sup> hide was 12 stone and 8 pound, the tallow was 19 stone,
the head 4 stone, y<sup>e</sup> Legs and feate weigh’d 3 stone 11<sup>£</sup>.
This Gentleman breeds and feeds much Cattle in his grounds
and has one of y<sup>e</sup> largest Beeves in England.</p>

<p class='c012'>his house is built with bricke and Coyn’d w<sup>th</sup> stone w<sup>th</sup> a flatt
Roofe Leaded, w<sup>th</sup> railes and Barristers, and a large Cupilow
in y<sup>e</sup> middle—you may see a Greate way round y<sup>e</sup> Country.
Y<sup>e</sup> ffront Entrance is 3 gates of Iron Barres and spikes,
painted blew with gold tops, and brick work between y<sup>e</sup>
gates and pillars with stone tops Carv’d Like flower potts;
y<sup>e</sup> pillars all Coyn’d with Stone. Y<sup>e</sup> Middle gate is made
large in a Compass like a halfe Moone.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span> There are four more spaces in the wall open with Iron
barres and spikes, 2 of w<sup>ch</sup> are in each side into y<sup>e</sup> Gardens,
and answers two Like them on the other side of the Gardens.
The two other are Less and are at y<sup>e</sup> End of a terrass walk
just along y<sup>e</sup> Entrance w<sup>ch</sup> you ascend by Steps from the
Middle gate; they are all adorned with brick pillars Coyn’d
w<sup>th</sup> stone and Stone heads—these are all painted blew and
gold tipps. From the Terrass you have a Court y<sup>t</sup> Leads
into y<sup>e</sup> middle of y<sup>e</sup> house into a large hall; over y<sup>e</sup> doore
at y<sup>e</sup> Entrance is a fine Carving of stone w<sup>th</sup> Leaves and
flowers with fine stone pillars, and y<sup>e</sup> Armes Cutt finely,
there is a fine dyal and Clock above all. The hall you
Enter is of a very good size and height. 2 dineing roomes
and drawing roomes, one for the Summer with a marble
floore, 6 or 7 Chambers off a good size and lofty, so y<sup>e</sup> most
of y<sup>e</sup> beds were two foote too low w<sup>ch</sup> was pitty they being
good beds, one was Crimson ffigured velvet, 2 damaske beds,
the rest moehaire and Cambet. Y<sup>e</sup> roomes were mostly
wanscoated and painted. Y<sup>e</sup> best roome was painted just
like marble—few roomes were hung. The ffurniture was
very neately kept and so was the whole house, the roofe of
y<sup>e</sup> Staires was finely painted, there was Severall pictures but
not Set up the house being in mourning for his Lady, and
her mother the Lady Yorke, w<sup>ch</sup> dyed in a month or two of
Each other. She left S<sup>r</sup> Edward 10 Children, he has a
great state and will have the 2000 P <sup>an</sup> fall to him that is
Lady Mary Ffenwichs anuity. he was a merchants son at
Bristol. The house is served with water by pipes into a
Cistern into y<sup>e</sup> Garden, Cellars and all offices. This was the
ffinest house I saw in Yorkshire. We returned to Knarsborough
9 mile and from thence we went to York againe 12
mile, this was y<sup>e</sup> worst Rideing in Yorkshire, then we
passed thro’ York town by another gate towards Hull, and
y<sup>t</sup> Streete was Larger and better buildings than what I saw
before in Yorke, and here we pass over the muddy River,
Called the muddy Ffosse. We passed over the river Derwent
that runns through the middle of Derbyshire to Born
Bridge 9 mile, Whitten 6 miles a Little neate Thatch’d
town of a mile long where we Lay, and passed by Burlington
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>Lord Cliffords house that stood in a bottom amongst
trees and Look’d well, and they Say is well painted and
good ffurniture, but I saw not y<sup>e</sup> Inside, only pass’d by it.
There we had a very Large Salmon that Cost and y<sup>e</sup> sauce
but 18<sup>d</sup>, it was very ffresh and good and above 3 quarters of
a yard long. Thence to Beverly 9 miles w<sup>ch</sup> is a very fine
town for its size, its prefferable to any town I saw but
Nottingham. There are 3 or 4 Large Streetes well pitch’d
bigger than any in York, the other Lesser Streets about y<sup>e</sup>
town being Equal with them. The Market Cross is Large,
there are 3 markets, one for beasts another for Corne and
another for ffish, all Large, the town is Serv’d with Water
by wells walled up round or rather in a Square, above halfe
ones length, and by a pully and weight letts down or draws
up the Buckat w<sup>ch</sup> is Chained to y<sup>e</sup> beame of y<sup>e</sup> pully.
There are many of these wells in all the streetes it seemes
its in Imitation of Holland, they being supply’d with water
soe. The buildings are new and pretty Lofty, the Minster
has been a ffine building all stone, Carv’d on the outside
w<sup>th</sup> ffigures and Images, and more than 100 pedastalls that
remaine where Statues has stood of angels and the like.
The wood worke in the quire is very ffine. Just by the
Comunion table is the Sanctuary or place of Refuge
where Criminalls flee for Safety—its a Seate of Stone work
Cut all in one.</p>

<p class='c012'>Earle of Northumberland’s and Lady’s Monuments—his
is very plaine, only a marble Stone raised up with Stone
about 2 yards high; his Name, by means of his great
atchievments in the Barrons warre, great Percy Earle of
Northumberland, is monument Enough to posterity. His
tombe was a little fallen in and a hole So bigg as many put
their hands in and touch’d the body w<sup>ch</sup> was much of it
Entire of y<sup>e</sup> bonds; the Skull was whole and the teeth
firme, tho’ of so many yeares standing. The Countess’s
monument is very fine, its made of y<sup>e</sup> same free stone y<sup>e</sup>
Church is built w<sup>th</sup>, but so finely polished y<sup>t</sup> it looks like
Marble, and Carv’d w<sup>th</sup> figures, birds leaves, flowers, beasts
and all sorts of things and y<sup>e</sup> armes is Cutt out in severall
places all about it; the top of the arch is one Entire Stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>as much as one Can Grasp and its all finely Carv’d w<sup>th</sup> all
sorts of Curiosityes and adorn’d with Gilding and painting.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are 4 good monuments all of marble of y<sup>e</sup> Wharton
ffamily. In the middle of y<sup>e</sup> Church is y<sup>e</sup> tomb of S<sup>t</sup> John
with a brass Inscription on y<sup>e</sup> pavement, and at a little
distance they shew’d us the wearing of y<sup>e</sup> pavement with y<sup>e</sup>
obeisance of his votarys, this being S<sup>t</sup> John of Beverly. At
the End of y<sup>e</sup> Church is y<sup>e</sup> ffont, y<sup>e</sup> upper part of it, that is
the bason was of one Entire marble of a Darke Coullour.
Y<sup>e</sup> Cover was Carv’d Exactly and of a Piramidy fform and
very high. There is another Church Called S<sup>t</sup> Mary’s y<sup>t</sup> is
very large and good I thought that had been the Minster
at first Entrance of y<sup>e</sup> town; there is the prayers Everyday
and its used on all accounts and so the other is neglected.
This has a quire in which they were preaching w<sup>n</sup> we were
there. There is a very good free schoole for boys, they say
y<sup>e</sup> best in England for Learning and Care w<sup>ch</sup> makes it fill’d
with Gentlemens Sons besides the free Schollars from all
parts—provision being very Cheape here. I was offered a
large Codffish for a shilling and good Pearch very Cheape,
we had Crabbs bigger than my two hands pence apiece w<sup>ch</sup>
would have Cost 6 pence if not a shilling in London and
they were very sweete. From thence we went to Hull 6
mile all upon a Caussey secured w<sup>th</sup> two little rivers running
on Each Side w<sup>ch</sup> is used to flow over their grounds it
being a Great fflatt severall miles, and the meadows are
Cloth’d w<sup>th</sup> good Grass by y<sup>t</sup> means. The river Hull runns
from Beverly at the town End, just by y<sup>e</sup> Minster you
Cross it, this runns to Hull, y<sup>e</sup> town is properly Called so
from that River, but its name is Kingston on y<sup>e</sup> Hull, being
built on y<sup>t</sup> River w<sup>ch</sup> runns into y<sup>e</sup> Humber w<sup>ch</sup> is a noble
River—y<sup>e</sup> mouth of it opens just ag<sup>st</sup> this town. The
buildings of Hull are very neate good streets, its a good
tradeing town by means of this great River Humber y<sup>t</sup>
Ebbs and flows Like the Sea, and is 3 or 4 mile over at y<sup>e</sup>
Least; it runns 20 mile hence into y<sup>e</sup> Sea and takes in all
y<sup>e</sup> great Rivers—y<sup>e</sup> Trent Ouise, Aire, Don, y<sup>e</sup> Derwent and
y<sup>e</sup> Hull, and Carries much water that a man of warre of all
sorts Can Ride. I was on board a new man of warre y<sup>t</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>belonged to the town and Called y<sup>e</sup> Kingston, it was but
small, well Compact for provision and was built fit for swift
saileing. The Humber is very salt, allwayes it rowles and
tosses just like y<sup>e</sup> Sea, only y<sup>e</sup> soile being Clay turnes y<sup>e</sup>
Water and waves yellow and soe it differs from y<sup>e</sup> Sea in
Coullour, not Else—its a hazardous water by reason of
many shoares y<sup>e</sup> tides meete. I was on it a pretty way and
it seemes more turbulent than y<sup>e</sup> Thames at Gravesend.</p>

<p class='c012'>We enter y<sup>e</sup> town of Hull from y<sup>e</sup> Southward over two
drawbridges and gates, there is the Same Entrance in
another part of y<sup>e</sup> town by 2 gates and 2 drawbridges from
Holderness, and so y<sup>e</sup> ditches are round y<sup>e</sup> town to y<sup>e</sup>
Landward, and they Can by them floate y<sup>e</sup> grounds for 3
mile round w<sup>ch</sup> is a good ffortification. The Garrison and
plattforme w<sup>ch</sup> is the ffortification to y<sup>e</sup> Sea is in a very
uniforme ffigure and were it ffinished is thought it would be
the ffinest ffortification that Could be seen—its wall’d and
pallisadoed. I walked round it, and viewed it and when I
was on y<sup>e</sup> water, it seemes to runn a great Length and
would require many Soldiers to deffend y<sup>e</sup> halfe moons and
workes. In the town there is an hospitall y<sup>ts</sup> Called y<sup>e</sup>
Trinity house, for Seamens widdows, 30 is their Completm<sup>t</sup>,
their allowance 16<sup>d</sup> p<sup>r</sup> weeke and ffewell, they have a little
Chapple to it for prayers; over this building is a large
roome for Cordage and sailes, where they make them and
keep their Stores. In the middle of this roome there hangs
a Canoe to y<sup>e</sup> Roofe of y<sup>e</sup> Roome just bigg Enough for one
man to sit in, and the Effigie of a man that was taken w<sup>th</sup>
it, all his Cloths Cap and a Large bag behind him where in
his ffish and provision were, these were all made of y<sup>e</sup> skin
of ffishes and were y<sup>e</sup> same w<sup>ch</sup> he wore when taken, y<sup>e</sup>
forme of his face is only added and just resemble y<sup>e</sup> wild
man that they took, for so the Inscription Calls him, or y<sup>e</sup>
bonny boate man; he was taken by Cap<sup>tn</sup> Baker and there
are his oars and spear y<sup>t</sup> was with him—this is all written
on y<sup>e</sup> boat to perpetuate y<sup>e</sup> memory of it; he would not
speak any Language or word to them y<sup>t</sup> took him nor
would he Eate, so in a few dayes died. There is a good
large Church in Hull. You Enter a large jsle just in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Middle that runns quite aCross through the Church, and
divides the body of the Church w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> pulpet and pews on one
Side with a partition of wood Carv’d, and on the other side
was such another partition for y<sup>e</sup> Chancell, and I observ’d
there their alter stood tablewise for y<sup>e</sup> Comunion just in
the middle of y<sup>e</sup> Chancell, as it was in the primitive tymes
before Popery Came in. There was Severall Little monuments
of marble in y<sup>e</sup> walls. Ffrom thence to Beverly
againe 6 mile w<sup>ch</sup> is all a flatt, thence to Brance Burton 8
mile, all likewise on a Levell w<sup>ch</sup> they Call Loughs. Here
we Could get no accomodation at a Publick house, it being
a Sad poore thatch’d place and only 2 or 3 Sorry Alehouses,
no lodgings but at y<sup>e</sup> hall house as it was Called Where
liv’d a Quaker w<sup>ch</sup> were Sufficient people. The rooms were
good old rooms being y<sup>e</sup> Lord of the mannours house—these
were but tennants—but did Entertain us kindly, made
two good beds for us and also for our Servants, and good
bread and Cheese, bacon and Eggs. Thence we went to
Agnes-Burton 7 mile, the miles are long and so they are in
most part of these Northern County’s. This is the East
Rideing of Yorkshire and we saw y<sup>e</sup> Session house at
Beverly for this Rideing.</p>

<p class='c012'>Agnes Burton is a Seate of S<sup>r</sup> Griffith Boyntons, Grandson
to S<sup>r</sup> ffrancis w<sup>ch</sup> married my father’s Sister one of William
Lord Viscount Say and Seales Daughters.</p>

<p class='c012'>It looks finely In the approach. A mile or two off we
pass by another of his houses w<sup>ch</sup> is newer built and very
good Gardens, Called Barmstone,—we Eate some of y<sup>e</sup>
good ffruite. The house is all built with Bricks and so good
Bricke that at 100 years standing no one Brick is faulty; it
stands on a pretty ascent. We Enter under a Gate-house
built w<sup>th</sup> 4 large towers into a Court which is large, in y<sup>e</sup>
middle is a Bowling green palisado’d round, and y<sup>e</sup> Coaches
runns round it to the Entrance w<sup>ch</sup> is by 10 stepps up to a
Tarress, and thence a pav’d walke to y<sup>e</sup> house. Cut box
and ffilleroy and Lawrell about y<sup>e</sup> Court. The ffront Looks
very uniform with severall round buildings on each side
answerring Each other with Compass windows, and y<sup>e</sup>
middle is a Round building, and y<sup>e</sup> door Enters in in y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>side of y<sup>t</sup> tower w<sup>ch</sup> was y<sup>e</sup> old fashion in Building and is
like my brother Say’s house at Broughton.</p>

<p class='c012'>Out of an Entry you Come into a very Lofty good hall,
y<sup>e</sup> Screen at the Lower End (w<sup>ch</sup> divides it from y<sup>e</sup> Entry)
is ffinely Carv’d, the parlour and drawing roome are well
proportion’d roomes, and y<sup>e</sup> wanscoate is all well Carv’d,
y<sup>e</sup> moldings of y<sup>e</sup> doores and  Chimneys are finely Carv’d
w<sup>th</sup> Staggs and all sorts of beasts, woods and some leaves
and flowers and birds and angells &amp;c. There is beyond
this a very good little parlour w<sup>th</sup> plaine wanscoate painted
in veines like marble, dark and white Streakes. There is
a very good dineing roome over this and 5 very good
Chambers some well ffurnished, all very neate and Convenient
w<sup>th</sup> Closetts to their own apartments and Anty
roomes. There is much of y<sup>e</sup> Same ffine Carving in the
dineing roome, the Chambers are all wanscoated and
Carv’d, there is a noble gallery over all, with large windows
on y<sup>e</sup> sides and at Each End painted very Curiously, out
of w<sup>ch</sup> you view the whole Country round and discover the
shipps under saile though at a good distance. The Gardens
are large and are Capable of being made very ffine—they
now remaine in the old ffashion. There is gravell walks
and grass and Close walks, there is one walke all y<sup>e</sup> Length
of the Garden Called the Crooked walke, of grass well Cutt
and rowled, it is indented in and out in Corners, and so is
the wall w<sup>ch</sup> makes you thinke you are at y<sup>e</sup> End off the
walke Severall tymes before you are, by means of y<sup>e</sup>
Codling hedge that is on the other side. This Leads you
to a summer house that also opens to a large gravell walke
that runns the breadth of y<sup>e</sup> Garden to the house ward.
From Agnes Burton we went to Scarborough 14 mile.
We pass’d from this flatt to Boynton, thence ascended the
wouls or high hills so Called in this County, and it prov’d
misty w<sup>ch</sup> made our observations to be fixed on it that the
mist was thicker and more held in those high wouls as raine
or mist is in thick trees, so y<sup>e</sup> mist was much more there
than in y<sup>e</sup> plaine, so thick in some you Could not see the
top. We descended these high wouls by a steep and
hazardous precipice on one Side and y<sup>e</sup> way narrow.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span> Scarbrough is a very pretty Sea-port town built on the
Side of a high hill. The Church Stands in the most Eminent
place above all y<sup>e</sup> town and at Least 20 Steps you ascend
up into y<sup>e</sup> Churchyard. The ruines of a Large Castle
remaines, the Walls in Compass Severall acres of ground y<sup>t</sup>
feeds many beasts and milch Cows. Y<sup>e</sup> hill on w<sup>ch</sup> the
Castle Stands is very Steep and Severall trenches over one
another, round the walls all one Side of the Castle Stands
out to the sea shore a good Length. Its open to the Main
ocean and to secure the harbour there is a mole or halfe
moone, two, one within y<sup>e</sup> other something resembling the
Cobb at Lime in Sommersetshire. The sea when the tide
is in is Close up to the town and the bottom of a Ridge of
hills that runns from the town 5 or 6 mile in a Compass.
When its Ebb water it Leaves y<sup>e</sup> shore 400 yards all a
flatt, and such good sand, as you presently walke on it
without Sinking, y<sup>e</sup> Sand is so smooth and firme, and so
you may walke 5 or 6 mile on the Sand round by y<sup>e</sup> ffoote
of this Ridge of hills, w<sup>ch</sup> is the poynt by w<sup>ch</sup> all the
Shipps pass that go to NewCastle or that way. I see
70 saile of shipps pass the point and so Come onward at
some Distance off from the Castle, Supposed to be Colliers
and their Convoys. On this Sand by the Sea shore is y<sup>e</sup>
Spaw well w<sup>ch</sup> people frequent, and all the diversion is y<sup>e</sup>
walking on this sand twice a day at y<sup>e</sup> Ebb of the tide
and till its high tide and then they drink. Its something
from an Iron or Steele minerall but by means of the tide
flowing on it Every tyme. Especially spring tydes it
Covers y<sup>e</sup> well quite—and allwayes flowes up just to it,
w<sup>ch</sup> Leaves a brackish and saltness w<sup>ch</sup> makes it purge
pretty much, but they say y<sup>e</sup> Spring is so quick that it
soone Casts off y<sup>e</sup> Sea water; but in my opinion is y<sup>t</sup> the
whole spring and all the Springs that Bubble up all over the
sands must be agreable and of the sort of water the sea
is, being so just on the sea side and so neare must be
Influenc’d by y<sup>e</sup> salt water. It seems to be a pretty turbulent
Sea, I was on it in a little boate but found it very
rough even just in y<sup>e</sup> harbour, I suppose the Cause may
be from standing so open to y<sup>e</sup> Maine. The town has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>abundance of Quakers in it, most of their best Lodgings
were In quakers hands, they Entertain all people, soe in
Private houses in the town by way of ordinary, so much a
Meale and their Ale. Every one finds themselves—there are
a few Inns for horses only. I was at a quakers meeteing
in the town where 4 men and 2 women spoke one, after
another had done, but it seem’d such a Confusion and so inCoherent
that it very much moved my Compassion and
pitty to see their delusion and Ignorance and no less
Excited my thankfullness for the Grace of God that upheld
others from such Errors. I observ’d their prayers were
all made on the first person and single, though before the
body of people; it seems they allow not of ones being the
mouth of y<sup>e</sup> Rest in prayer to God tho’ it be in the publick
meetings. In this town we had good accomodations and
on very Reasonable terms. They drye a large ffish Like
Codlings and salt them and when you dress them, water them;
then they string them on wire, and so Rost them before the fire
and make good sauce for them, they Eate very well and as
tender as a fresh Codling and very sweete iff they were well
cured when they were first taken, Else they will taste stronge.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence we went to Maulton 14 miles w<sup>ch</sup> is a pretty
large town built of Stone but poor; there is a large market
place and severall great houses of gentlemens round the
town. There was one M<sup>r</sup> Paumes that marry’d a relation
of mine Lord Ewers Coeheiress who is landlady of almost
all y<sup>e</sup> town. She has a pretty house in the place. There is
the ruins of a very great house w<sup>ch</sup> belonged y<sup>e</sup> family
but they not agreeing about it Caused y<sup>e</sup> defaceing of it.
She now makes use of y<sup>e</sup> roomes off y<sup>e</sup> outbuildings and
gate house for weaving and Linning Cloth, haveing set up
a manuffactory for Linnen w<sup>ch</sup> does Employ many poor
people. She supply’d me w<sup>th</sup> very good beer, for y<sup>e</sup> Inn
had not the best. Thence to York 14 miles, and so to
Tadcaster 8 mile, thence to Aberfford 4 miles all on a
heavy bottom, their miles are long and I observe the
ordinary people both in these parts of Yorkshire and in the
northern parts Can scarce tell you how farre it is to the
next place unless it be in the great towns, and there in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>their publick houses, and they tell you its very good yate
Instead of Saying it is good way, and they Call their gates
yates, and do not Esteem it uphill unless so steep as a
house or precipice; they say its good levell gate all along
when it maybe there are Severall great hills to pass, but
this account did Encrease on us the nearer we Came to
Darbyshire, but in Generall they Live much at home and
scarce Ever go 2 or 10 mile from thence Especially the
women, so may be term’d good housekeepers. To Aberford
we Came by severall pretty Seates in view, we Lay at
an acquaintances house M<sup>rs</sup> Hickeringalls: thence we went
to Castleton Bridge 5 mile, where was a glass house; we
saw them blowing white glass and neale it in a large oven
by the heate of y<sup>e</sup> ffurnace. All the Country is full of
Coale and the pitts are so thick in y<sup>e</sup> roade that it is
hazardous to travell for strangers.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Pomffret 3 miles w<sup>ch</sup> Looks very finely in
the approach. Its built on a hill all of stone, its a very
neate building and y<sup>e</sup> streets well pitch’d and broad, the
houses well built and looks more stately than any in York,
only its not the tenth part so bigg, its a neate little town as
I have seen. there are severall very good houses in it, one
Doct<sup>r</sup> Burgess has built a very good house w<sup>ch</sup> is Call’d his
ffolly. There is a noble house at the Entrance of the town
of y<sup>e</sup> Lady Grace Perpoynt, and good Parke Gardens and
walks and a great revenue belonging to it,—the Daughter of
the Marquis of Dorchesters. There is a ffine Church in the
town and as spacious a market place as is at Salisbury or as
you shall see any where, and the building so Even and
uniforme as well as Lofty that it appears very magnificent—its
a Major town. We were in the Chief Inn the Sunn,
tho’ there are many good Inns, but this was a very good
Genteel jnn and it happen’d the Landlord was then Major
of y<sup>e</sup> town.</p>

<p class='c012'>Provisions are very Easy here, we had 2 or 3 pound of
Codffish for a small matter and it was a Large dish. Y<sup>e</sup>
town is full of Great Gardens walled in all round on y<sup>e</sup>
outside of the town, on the Edge of y<sup>e</sup> hill so the Gardens
runns down a great way, you descend with them by severall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>stepps. Its a fruitfull place, fine flowers and trees with all
sorts of fruite, but that w<sup>ch</sup> is mostly jntended is the Encreasing
of Liquorish w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Gardens are all filled with, and
any body that has a Little ground improves it for the
produce of Liquorish of w<sup>ch</sup> there is vast quantetyes, and it
returns severall 100 pounds yearly to the towns. The Leafe
is not much unlike a Rose Leafe but some w<sup>t</sup> narrower and
Longer, the Coullour is something a Yellower Green, Else
the branches grow Like it w<sup>th</sup> double Leaves on a Stalke
and severall all down y<sup>e</sup> Stalke, somewhat in the manner of
Caliceily or Solomons Seale and much of that smoothness
of Leafe. Thence to Hemsworth 4 mile where we Could
meet w<sup>th</sup> no Lodging, only Little ale houses to give one a
pot of beere, and so we went 2 mile ffarther but found it y<sup>e</sup>
same and it being too farre to reach Rotheram we made use
of ye hospitallity of a Clergyman one M<sup>r</sup> Fferrer w<sup>ch</sup> was a
very Genteele man and gave us a Civil Entertainm<sup>t</sup> and
good beds—he has a very good house and Genteely
ffitted good Hall and parlour, and the Garden very neate.
Its a very ffruitfull Country w<sup>ch</sup> Encourages jndustry and
there is plenty of Stone Like free Stone w<sup>ch</sup> makes ffine
houses and walls. Thence to Rotheram 12 miles, its most
in a deep Clay ground and now the wayes are more difficult
and narrow. Rotheram is a good market town well built all
of stone. The Church stands high in y<sup>e</sup> middle of the town
and Looks finely, its all Stone and Carv’d very well all the
out side. Thence to Ackington 8 mile, a very Little place
its 3 mile from Shellton town, but that was thought out of
our way, so we Lay here in a poor Sorry Inn. There was
one good bed for us Gentlewomen. Its a pretty Long Parish
and through it runns a Water which Came down a great
banck at the End of y<sup>e</sup> town like a precipice with such violence
y<sup>t</sup> it makes a great noise, and looks Extreamely Cleare
in the Streame that gushes out and runns along: it runns
on off a deep yellow Coullour, they say it runns off of a
poisonous mine or Soile and from Coale pitts; they permit
none to taste it for I sent for a Cup of it and y<sup>e</sup> people in y<sup>e</sup>
Streete Call’d out to forbid y<sup>e</sup> tasteing it, and it will beare
no Soape so its useless. Here we Entred Darbyshire and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>went to Chesterffield 6 mile, and Came by y<sup>e</sup> Coale mines
where they were digging. They make their mines at y<sup>e</sup>
Entrance Like a Well and so till they Come to y<sup>e</sup> Coale,
then they digg all the Ground about where there is Coale
and set pillars to support it, and so bring it to y<sup>e</sup> well where
by a basket Like a hand barrow by Cords they pull it up—so
they Let down and up the miners with a Cord. Chesterffield
Looks Low when you approach it from the Adjacent
hill w<sup>ch</sup> you descend, but then you ascend another to it.
The Coale pitts and quaraes of stone are all about, Even
just at y<sup>e</sup> town End, and in the town its all built of stone.
Y<sup>e</sup> Church stands in a place of Eminency, the town Looks
well, the Streets good, y<sup>e</sup> Market very Large. It was
Satturday w<sup>ch</sup> is their market day and there was a great
Market Like some little ffaire, a great deale of Corne and
all sorts of ware and ffowles there. I bought my self 2 very
good ffatt white (pullings as they Call them) pullets for 6
pence both, and I am sure they were as Large and as good
as would have Cost 18 pence if not 2 shill<sup>s</sup> a piece in
London—so said all my Company. In this town is y<sup>e</sup> best
ale in the Kingdom Generally Esteem’d. All Derbyshire is
full of Steep hills and nothing but the peakes of hills as
thick one by another is seen in most of y<sup>e</sup> County w<sup>ch</sup> are
very steepe, w<sup>ch</sup> makes travelling tedious and y<sup>e</sup> miles Long.
You see neither hedge nor tree but only Low drye stone
walls round some ground Else its only hills and Dales as
thick as you Can Imagine, but tho’ the Surface of y<sup>e</sup> Earth
Looks barren yet those hills are impregnated w<sup>th</sup> Rich
marble stone metals, Iron and Copper and Coale mines in
their bowells, from whence we may see the wisdom and
benignitye of o<sup>er</sup> greate Creator to make up the Defficiency
of a place by an Equivolent, and also the diversity of the
Creation w<sup>ch</sup> Encreaseth its Beauty. We go from Chesterffield
to y<sup>e</sup> Duke of Devonshires house and ascend a high
hill at Least two or three miles Long, we pass’d by a Cavity
in one great Banck or Rock Called Stonidge Hall all stone
of about 12 yards long and about 4 or 5 broad, its all Rock
like an arch on y<sup>e</sup> Roofe but its not ffenc’d so but y<sup>e</sup> beasts
trample and ffowle it you Can scarce go into it. The same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>long steep hill we had to descend w<sup>ch</sup> Comes to Chattsworth
ten mile. The Duke’s house Lyes just at y<sup>e</sup> foote of this
steepe hill w<sup>ch</sup> is like a precipice just at y<sup>e</sup> Last, notwithstanding
the Dukes house stands on a little riseing ground
from y<sup>e</sup> River Derwent w<sup>ch</sup> runns all along y<sup>e</sup> front of y<sup>e</sup>
house, and by a Little fall made in y<sup>e</sup> water w<sup>ch</sup> makes a
pretty Murmurring noise. Before y<sup>e</sup> gate there is a Large
parke and Severall ffine Gardens one w<sup>th</sup> out another w<sup>th</sup>
Gravell walkes and Squairs of Grass w<sup>th</sup> stone statues in
them, and in y<sup>e</sup> middle of Each Garden is a Large ffountaine
full of Images, sea gods and Dolphins and sea horses w<sup>ch</sup>
are full of pipes w<sup>ch</sup> spout out water in the bason and
spouts all about the Gardens. 3 gardens just round the
house. Out of two of y<sup>e</sup> Gardens you ascend by Severall
Stepps into other Gardens w<sup>ch</sup> some have Gravell walks and
squares Like y<sup>e</sup> other w<sup>th</sup> Statues and Images in the bason.
There is one bason in the Middle of one Garden thats very
Large and by sluces besides the Images Severall pipes plays
out y<sup>e</sup> water—about 30 Large and small pipes altogether,
some fflush it up that it ffrothes Like snow. There is one
Garden full of stone and brass statues. So the Gardens
Lyes one above another w<sup>ch</sup> makes the prospect very fine.
Above these gardens is an ascent of 5 or 6 stepps up to
green walk and groves of firrs and a wilderness and Close
arbours and shady walks. On Each End of one Walke
stands two piramidies full of pipes spouting water that runns
down one of them—runns on brass hollow work w<sup>ch</sup> looks
like rocks and hollow stones.</p>

<p class='c012'>Y<sup>e</sup> other is all fflatts, stands one above another like
Salvers so the water rebounds one from another 5 or 6 one
above the Other. There is another green walke and about
y<sup>e</sup> Middle of it by y<sup>e</sup> Grove stands a fine Willow tree, the
Leaves, Barke and all looks very naturall, y<sup>e</sup> roote is full of
rubbish or great stones to appearance and all on a Sudden
by turning a sluce it raines from Each Leafe and from the
branches like a shower, it being made of Brass and pipes to
Each Leafe, but in appearance is Exactly like any Willow.
Beyond this is a bason in w<sup>ch</sup> are y<sup>e</sup> branches of two
Artichock Leaves w<sup>ch</sup> weeps at y<sup>e</sup> End of Each Leafe into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>the bason w<sup>ch</sup> is placed at y<sup>e</sup> foote of Lead steps 30 in
number. The Lowest step is very deep, and between Every
4 stepps is a half pace all made of Lead and are broad on
Each side. On a little banck stands blew balls 10 on a
side, and between Each ball are 4 pipes w<sup>ch</sup> by a sluce
spouts out water aCross y<sup>e</sup> stepps to Each other like an
arbour or arch. While you are thus amused suddenly
there runs down a torrent of water out of 2 pitchers in y<sup>e</sup>
hands of two Large nimphs Cut in stone that Lyes in the
upper step w<sup>ch</sup> makes a pleaseing prospect. This is designed
to be Enlarged and Steps made up to y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup> hill w<sup>ch</sup>
is a vast ascent, but ffrom y<sup>e</sup> top of it now they are
Supply’d w<sup>th</sup> water for all their pipes so it will be the
Easyer to have such a fall of water Even from y<sup>e</sup> top w<sup>ch</sup>
will add to the Curiositye. The house is built all of Stone
y<sup>t</sup> is dugg out of the hills, its like free stone—a flatt Roofe
w<sup>th</sup> Barristers and flower potts. In the ffront is 7 large
windows, the glass is diamond Cutt and all off large
Looking glass, y<sup>e</sup> panes bigg 4 in a breadth 7 in height, to
the Garden ward was 12 windows of y<sup>e</sup> same glass 4 panes
broad 8 long, y<sup>e</sup> Lowest windows are made w<sup>th</sup> Grates
before them and are for birds—an Averye—and so looking
glass behind. Y<sup>e</sup> stepps out of y<sup>e</sup> Garden are on Either
side 20 steps and Iron barrs painted blew and tipt w<sup>th</sup> gold.
Y<sup>e</sup> steps meete on y<sup>e</sup> top in a halfe pace railed y<sup>e</sup> same, but
y<sup>e</sup> front entrance is not finished; there is a large Court w<sup>ch</sup>
is to be pas’d and so stepps on Each side of stone w<sup>th</sup> half
paces up to a tarrass walke. Y<sup>e</sup> large gates of jron barrs
are 3 at y<sup>e</sup> Court and from this tarress you Enter. The
ffront is w<sup>th</sup> Severall Large stone pillars Carv’d, at y<sup>e</sup>
Entrance into another Court w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup> house is built about, and
here are peaso’s supported w<sup>th</sup> stone pillars, under w<sup>ch</sup> you
pass from one place to another. Out of it is y<sup>e</sup> Chappel w<sup>ch</sup>
is a very lofty building and supported by 4 large pillars of
black marble, two at y<sup>e</sup> alter, 2 just at y<sup>e</sup> bottom to support
y<sup>e</sup> gallery for y<sup>e</sup> Duke and Dutches to sitt in. Y<sup>e</sup> pillars
are 14 foote, and so bigg that I could not Compass one w<sup>th</sup>
my arms. These 4 and 2 stepps by y<sup>e</sup> alter was made out
of one stone Cut out of y<sup>e</sup> hill just by, so is all y<sup>e</sup> marble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>about the house and so finely polish’d like a Looking glass;
the pavem<sup>t</sup> is black and white marble vein’d, Lay’d long
wayes in large stones all of y<sup>e</sup> same. Y<sup>e</sup> painting is very
fine, on the top and on the sides y<sup>e</sup> history of Christ and y<sup>e</sup>
New testament. There is a very fine Carving of wood and
Stone, the Dove at the alter y<sup>e</sup> Angels and Cherubims w<sup>th</sup>
flowers, Leaves Laurell &amp;c. &amp;c. very Curiously Carv’d.
The hall is very Lofty, painted top and Sides with armory
and there is 18 steps on Each side goes up as an arch, w<sup>th</sup>
Iron Barristers tipt w<sup>th</sup> gold w<sup>ch</sup> Meetes on y<sup>e</sup> top Large
steps of stone. Thence you Enter a dineing roome, two
drawing roomes, a bed Chamber and Closet w<sup>ch</sup> opens quite
thro’ the house a visto, and at the End of the dineing roome
is a Large door all of Looking glass in great pannells all
diamond Cutt. This is just opposite to y<sup>e</sup> doores that runs
into y<sup>e</sup> drawing roome and bed Chamber and Closet so it
shews y<sup>e</sup> roomes to Look all double. Ye ffloores of y<sup>e</sup>
Roomes are all finely Inlaid, there is very Curious Carving
over and Round the Chimney pieces, and Round the
Looking-glasses that are in y<sup>e</sup> peers between the windows,
and fine Carv’d shelves or stands on Each side of y<sup>e</sup> glass.
Every roome is differing work and all fine Carving and over
y<sup>e</sup> doores some of it is of y<sup>e</sup> Natural Coull<sup>r</sup> of y<sup>e</sup> wood and
varnish’d only—others painted. Ye Dutchess’s Closet is
wanscoated w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> hollow burnt japan, and at Each Corner
are peers of Looking glass; over the Chimney is Looking
glass an oval and at the 4 Corners after this figure <span class='c025'>⌘</span>,
and hollow Carving all round y<sup>e</sup> glass. The roomes are
all painted very finely on y<sup>e</sup> top; all y<sup>e</sup> windows y<sup>e</sup> Squares
of glass are so large and good they Cost 10s. a pannell.
There was sweete tapistry hangings with small figures and
very much silk, they Look’d as ffresh as if new tho’ bought
severall yeares—there were no beds up. There was as
many roomes on the other side w<sup>ch</sup> were not ffinished, they
were just painting y<sup>e</sup> Ceilings and Laying the floores w<sup>ch</sup>
are all jnlaid, these were the Duke and dutchess’s apartm<sup>ts</sup>
besides which are a great number of roomes and severall
offices. There is a fine Grottoe all stone pavement Roofe
and sides, this is design’d to supply all y<sup>e</sup> house w<sup>th</sup> water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>besides severall ffanceyes to make diversion. Within this is
a batheing roome, y<sup>e</sup> walls all w<sup>th</sup> blew and white marble—the
pavement mix’d, one stone white, another black, another
of y<sup>e</sup> Red vaned marble. The bath is one Entire marble
all white finely veined w<sup>th</sup> blew and is made smooth, but
had it been as finely pollish’d as some it would have been
the finest marble that Could be seen. It was as deep as
ones middle on the outside, and you went down steps into
y<sup>e</sup> bath big enough for two people. At y<sup>e</sup> upper End are
two Cocks to let in one hott, y<sup>e</sup> other Cold water to attemper
it as persons please—the Windows are all private Glass.
The Gallery we ascended out of y<sup>e</sup> hall into before we Came
to y<sup>e</sup> dineing roome, w<sup>ch</sup> I should have spoken off then,
was delicately painted over head, and Round on the top
was a raile and Barristers so naturally drawn just round the
Cornish, that you would take it for a Railed walke round y<sup>e</sup>
top to looke down into the gallery, There is another ffine
staircase all stone and hangs on it self on y<sup>e</sup> outside, y<sup>e</sup>
support is from y<sup>e</sup> wall and its own building. Ye stone of
y<sup>e</sup> half paces are large and one Entire stone makes Each.
On the top of y<sup>e</sup> Staires y<sup>e</sup> space Leading to y<sup>e</sup> roomes are
3 large Stones, the Stones Cost 20<sup>£</sup> a piece, so large and
thick you would wonder how they should be raised up so
high and be supported by its own arch without any pillars
on y<sup>e</sup> outside. This is all of Stone Cut out of y<sup>e</sup> hills w<sup>ch</sup>
Looks like what we Call free stone. Y<sup>e</sup> house is all off the
same and all the marble in y<sup>e</sup> Windows, Chimneys and
pavements is all marble dug out of the hill above the house,
both black, white rance, and Curiously veined and polished,
so fine as any I ever saw w<sup>ch</sup> Came from beyond sea.
Thence we came to Bankwell a pretty neate market town
2 mile; it Stands on a hill, yet you descend a vast hill to it
w<sup>ch</sup> you would thinke impossible to go down, and we was
forced to fetch a Great Compass, and by reason of y<sup>e</sup> steepness
and hazard of y<sup>e</sup> wayes if you take a wrong Way there
is no passing. You are forced to have guides as in all parts
of Darbyshire, and unless it be a few y<sup>t</sup> use to be guides y<sup>e</sup>
Common people know not above 2 or 3 mile from their
home, but they of y<sup>e</sup> Country will Climbe up and down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>w<sup>th</sup> their horses those steep precipices. There are many
fine springs of water purling out of y<sup>e</sup> Rock on these hills.
At Bankwell there was an Excellent Minister in y<sup>e</sup> Publick
who pray’d and preach’d very seriously and his Life and
Conversation is suitable, not very frequent in our dayes to
be found.</p>

<p class='c012'>We went 3 mile off in the afternoone to heare another y<sup>t</sup>
was in a meeteing and so 3 mile home againe. Y<sup>e</sup> hills
about y<sup>e</sup> town and all about y<sup>e</sup> town is rocks of y<sup>e</sup> finest
marble of all sorts—huge Rock. I took some of it and
shewing it to severall they think it Comparable to any
beyond sea. Thence to Haddon Hall for so all y<sup>e</sup> great
houses are called, as Chatsworth Hall, so this Haddon Hall
the Earle of Rutlands house 2 mile from Bankwell; its a
good old house all built of stone on a hill and behind it is a
ffine grove of high trees and good Gardens, but nothing
very Curious as y<sup>e</sup> mode now is. There is a large Parke
upon a great ascent from y<sup>e</sup> house which is built round a
Court, y<sup>e</sup> parke is one part of some of y<sup>e</sup> highest hills w<sup>ch</sup>
gives a great prospect over y<sup>e</sup> Country. But Indeed all
Darbyshire is but a world of peaked hills, which from some
of y<sup>e</sup> highest you discover y<sup>e</sup> Rest Like steeples or tops of
hills as thick as Can be, and tho’ they appear so Close yet
y<sup>e</sup> steepness down and up takes up y<sup>e</sup> tyme, y<sup>t</sup> you go it as
if so many Miles, and were y<sup>e</sup> ground measur’d would be in
Length as much as miles on a plaine. Thence to Buxton
9 mile over those Craggy hills Whose Bowells are full of
mines of all kinds off Black and white and veined Marbles,
and some have mines of Copper, others tinn and Leaden
mines, in w<sup>ch</sup> is a great deale of silver. I have some w<sup>ch</sup>
Looks full of silver, its so bright just brought up out of one
of y<sup>e</sup> mines. They digg down their mines Like a well for
one man to be let down w<sup>th</sup> a Rope and pulley, and so
when they find oar they keep digging under ground to
follow the oar w<sup>ch</sup> lies amongst the stone y<sup>t</sup> Lookes like our
fine stones. In y<sup>t</sup> mine I saw there was 3 or 4 at work and
all let down thro’ y<sup>e</sup> well; they digg sometymes a great
way before they Come to oar. There is also a sort of stuff
they dig out mixt w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> oar and all about the hills they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Call Sparr, it looks like Crystal or white sugar Candy, its
pretty hard; y<sup>e</sup> doctors use it in medicine for the Collick;
its smooth like glass but it looks all in Crack’s all over.
They Wall round the Wells to y<sup>e</sup> mines to Secure their
Mold’ring in upon them, they Generally Look very pale
and yellow that work Underground, they are fforc’d to keep
Lights w<sup>th</sup> them and sometymes are forced to use Gunpowder
to break y<sup>e</sup> stones, and y<sup>t</sup> is sometymes Hazardous
to the people and destroys them at y<sup>e</sup> work. Its very
difficult to find the Wayes here for you see only tops of
hills and so many roads—by reason of y<sup>e</sup> best wayes up
and down—that its impossible for Coach or Waggon to
pass some of y<sup>m</sup>, and you scarce see a tree and No hedges
all over y<sup>e</sup> Country, only dry stone walls y<sup>t</sup> incloses ground
no other ffence. Buxton we Saw 2 or 3 tymes and then
Lost y<sup>e</sup> sight of it as often, and at last did not See it till
just you Came upon it—that 9 mile we were above 6 hours
going it. The house thats Call’d Buxton Hall w<sup>ch</sup> belongs
to y<sup>e</sup> Duke of Devonshire its where the warme bath is and
well, its the Largest house in the place tho’ not very good;
they are all Entertaining houses and its by way of an
ordinary—so much a piece for y<sup>r</sup> dinners and suppers and
so much for our Servants besides; all y<sup>e</sup> ale and wine is to
be paid—besides, the beer they allow at the meales is so
bad y<sup>t</sup> very Little Can be dranke. You pay not for y<sup>r</sup> bed
roome and truely the other is so unreasonable a price and
y<sup>e</sup> Lodgings so bad, 2 beds in a Roome some 3 beds and
4 in one roome, so that if you have not Company Enough
of your own to fill a Room they will be ready to put others
into the same Chamber, and sometymes they are so Crowded
that three must Lye in a bed. Few people stay above two
or three nights its so Inconvenient. We staid two nights
by reason one of our Company was ill, but it was sore
against our Wills for there is no peace nor quiet with one
Company and another going into the bath or Coming out;
that makes so many strive to be in this house because the
bath is in it. Its about 40 foot Long and about 20 or 30
ffoote broad being almost square. There is 10 or 12 springs
that bubble up that are a Little warme, its not so warme as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>milke from y<sup>e</sup> Cow, and not a quick spring, so y<sup>t</sup> its not
Capable of being Cleansed after Everybody has been in.
Its warme Enough just to Open the pores of ones body,
but not to Cause sweat, I was in it and it made me shake,
its farre from the heate that is in the Somersetshire baths.
Its Cover’d over the top, but not Ceiled and there is an
open place in the middle like a Tunnell w<sup>ch</sup> pours the Cold
down on y<sup>e</sup> head, it would in my thoughts be better if it
were Exposed all to y<sup>e</sup> aire and sunn. There is a pavem<sup>t</sup> of
Stone on one side at y<sup>e</sup> brim to walke on, with benches of
Stone to Sitt on. You must have a guide y<sup>t</sup> Swims with
you, you may Stand in some place and hold by a Chaine
and y<sup>e</sup> water is not above y<sup>r</sup> Neck, but in other parts very
deep and strong it will turn you down. About 10 or 12
yards distant is a spring Called S<sup>t</sup> Anns Well w<sup>ch</sup> is for
drinking, they have arch’d it up y<sup>t</sup> its much hotter, it heates
y<sup>e</sup> Cup you take it up in but not or near so hot as y<sup>e</sup>
Somersetshire baths and springs are, the taste is not
unpleasant but Rather like Milk, they say its Diaretick—I
dranke a part of a Cup full.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another wonder is that of Pooles hole, thats just at y<sup>e</sup>
towns End, a Large Cavity under ground of a Great Length.
Just at the Entrance you must Creep, but presently you
stand upright, its Roofe being very Lofty all arched in the
Rocks and sound with a great Ecchoe. Y<sup>e</sup> Rocks are
Continually droping water all about, you pass over Loose
stones and Craggy Rocks. The dripping of the water wears
impression on y<sup>e</sup> Stones that forms them into Severall
Shapes, there is one Looks Like a Lyon w<sup>th</sup> a Crown on his
head, y<sup>e</sup> water trickling on it weares it into so many shapes;
another place Lookes just Like y<sup>e</sup> shape of a Large organ
w<sup>th</sup> ye severall Keys and pipes one above another as you
see in a great Cathedrall; there is also a Stone w<sup>ch</sup> Looks
white and in shape Like a salted flitch of Bacon w<sup>ch</sup> hangs
down from the Roofe of y<sup>e</sup> Arch w<sup>ch</sup> is very Lofty in this
place. There is another Rock Looks like a Chaire of State
w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Canopy and all glistring like diamonds or starrs;
thus does all y<sup>e</sup> sides of the Rock all shine Like Diamonds.
Y<sup>e</sup> Rocks are very Large and Craggy and Indented, some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Looks like y<sup>e</sup> outsides of Cockle shells, others are smooth
all Caused I believe from y<sup>e</sup> dripping of y<sup>e</sup> Water. I was
as farre as y<sup>e</sup> Queen of Scotts pillar, w<sup>ch</sup> is a Large white
stone, and y<sup>e</sup> top hangs over your head Like a Cannopy all
great white Stones and in spires or Large jceickles and
glistring as the other. They may go farther but I had no
such Curiosity, I had y<sup>e</sup> Light Carry’d that shewed me to
S<sup>t</sup> Anns Needle after w<sup>ch</sup> is only sand. This white stone is
very Like Chrystall of w<sup>ch</sup> there is a stone Like a Bason or
Large ffont wherein drops Continually y<sup>e</sup> water w<sup>ch</sup> runns
over and trickling down does as it were Candy in jceickles
and points, under w<sup>ch</sup> is a pillar of this white stone. We
had some broken off which Looks like y<sup>e</sup> jnsides of oyster-shells
or mother of pearle, some Looks like alabaster. As
I went I Clamber’d over the top of all y<sup>e</sup> stones and as I
Came back I pass’d under severall of y<sup>e</sup> arches Like bridges;
they are both wayes full of Loose stones and the water
dropping makes them slippery, it being also very uneven
by reason of y<sup>e</sup> Craggs. How it should Come none Can
give any good accō; its Call’d Pooles hole from a man of
that name that was a Robber and use to secure himself in
y<sup>t</sup> place like a house, and so y<sup>e</sup> Country people imagined he
made it, but some think it was dug to find mines or marble
or Chrystal because y<sup>e</sup> mettle mines are full of stone as I s<sup>d</sup>
before; only this Enters in y<sup>e</sup> side whereas the mines they
make now are as a well perpendicular for severall yards
before it spreads, and y<sup>t</sup> not till they Come to find metal,
but y<sup>e</sup> difficulty appears as to this hole how so large a
Cavity should be Left, as in some places y<sup>e</sup> Roofe is as
lofty as you can see and all stone; now how it should be
fixt so as not to tumble in by y<sup>e</sup> weight of y<sup>e</sup> Earth or stone
on y<sup>e</sup> top: as to y<sup>e</sup> waters dropping y<sup>t</sup> is but what is
Customary among rocks and stones, there are many springs
w<sup>ch</sup> run in y<sup>e</sup> veines of y<sup>e</sup> Earth and allwayes are running in
such subteraneus vaults in the Earth, w<sup>ch</sup> gather together
and runns in a little Channell in y<sup>e</sup> bottom of this Cave as
you may step one. The 4th wonder is that off Elden hole
about 2 mile from Buxton; its on y<sup>e</sup> side of a hill about 30
yards if not better in length at y<sup>e</sup> brimm, and half so broad,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>and just in sight is full of Craggy stones like a Rock for
about 2 or 3 yards down, w<sup>ch</sup> Contracts the Mouth of y<sup>e</sup>
hole to about 4 yards long and 2 broad or thereabouts;
w<sup>ch</sup> hole is Suppos’d to run down directly a vast length and
has been try’d w<sup>th</sup> a Line and plummet severall fathom and
the bottom not Sounded, tho’ some are of opinion its
because the hole runns aslant so the plummet and Line
Could not pass, and what we observ’d gives some strength
to this notion, for Cast a stone down you hear it Strike a
long tyme at the sides of y<sup>e</sup> hole, and if you go down below
100 y<sup>ds</sup> or more and Lay y<sup>r</sup> head to the ground you shall
hear the stone ring Much longer than those that stand at
the holes mouth, w<sup>ch</sup> must discover y<sup>e</sup> ground to be hollow
at Least much farther in Compass than the mouth of y<sup>e</sup>
hole, but its Certain it must be of a great depth by reason
of the tyme you Can hear a stone strike and ring in its
descending, and y<sup>t</sup> which Lessens the sound may be by its
breaking against the sides. Its a very hazardous place, for
if a man or beast be too near the Edge of y<sup>e</sup> bank and trip
they fall in w<sup>th</sup> out retrieve. Y<sup>e</sup> beasts graze in the Grounds
and hills but it must be some great force that drives them
near the hole; there is a sort of instinct in Nature, self
preservation and a great sence of danger in beasts; its
reported that severall Attempts have been made to ffence
the whole round w<sup>th</sup> a stone Wall as the manner of the
fences are all over y<sup>t</sup> Country, but yet it has been all in
vaine. What they built up in the day would be pull’d down
in y<sup>e</sup> night and so its vaine to trye y<sup>e</sup> securing it round
from any falling in—this the people tell us. The Country
here about is so full of moore or quagmires and such
precipices that one that is a stranger Cannot travell w<sup>th</sup> out
a guide, and some of them are put to a Loss sometymes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The fifth wonder is Mamtour w<sup>ch</sup> is a high hill that Looks
Exactly round, but on the side next Castleton w<sup>ch</sup> is a
Little town in the High Peake on that side its all broken
that it Looks just in resemblance as a great Hay-Ricke y<sup>ts</sup>
Cut down one halfe on one side—that describes it most
naturall. This is all sand, and on that broken side the sand
keeps trickling down allwayes Especially when there is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>Least wind of w<sup>ch</sup> I believe this Country scarce Ever is
w<sup>th</sup>out; many places of the hill Looks hollow and Loose w<sup>ch</sup>
makes it very dangerous to ascend and none does attempt
it, y<sup>e</sup> sand being Loose slips y<sup>e</sup> foote back againe.</p>

<p class='c012'>The 6<sup>th</sup> wonder is at Casleton 4 mile from Elderhole;
its a town Lyes at y<sup>e</sup> foote of an Exceeding steep hill w<sup>ch</sup>
Could not be descended by foote or horse, but in a Compass
and y<sup>t</sup> by y<sup>e</sup> Roads returning to and agen on y<sup>e</sup> side of y<sup>e</sup>
hill at Least 4 tymes before we Could gaine y<sup>e</sup> bottom or
top of s<sup>d</sup> Hill. This is w<sup>ch</sup> they Call the Devills Arse a
peake, the hill on one End jutting out in two parts and
joyns in one at y<sup>e</sup> top, this part or Cleft between you Enter
a great Cave w<sup>ch</sup> is very Large, and severall poor Little
houses in it built of Stone and thatch’d Like Little Styes,
one seemed a Little bigger in which a Gentleman Liv’d
and his wife y<sup>t</sup> was worth above 100<sup>£</sup> a year w<sup>ch</sup> he left to
his brother, Chooseing rather Like a hermite to Live in this
sorry Cell. One M<sup>r</sup> Midleton who was w<sup>th</sup> us s<sup>d</sup> he had
dined w<sup>th</sup> them there on Carrots and Herbs, and y<sup>t</sup> he was
dead and his wife a year or two since. Now none but very
poor people Live there w<sup>ch</sup> makes some small advantage by
begging and by Lighting the strangers into the Cave w<sup>ch</sup>
beyond this you Enter so straight a passage. At the
mouth you stoop very Low Even upon y<sup>r</sup> Breast and Creep
in, when you are about a yard or two’s Length you stand
upright, it being Lofty in manner of Poole’s Hole only the
Rock hangs down in so many places that there is often
Cause of Stooping very Low to pass by y<sup>m</sup>, and here y<sup>e</sup>
ground you tread on is all sand and firme, only y<sup>e</sup> Rocks do
drip water in many places w<sup>ch</sup> makes it damp and strikes
Cold to you, but Excepting the pillars of Rock in some
places that hang down y<sup>e</sup> most of it is very Lofty and a
great Ecchoe like a Church. You pass a good way by y<sup>e</sup>
Light of many Candles haveing Lost y<sup>e</sup> sight of day from
y<sup>e</sup> first stooping Entrance. At Last you Come to a river
they Call it, a great water it is and very deep, they say its
about 12 yards over and some do go on it w<sup>th</sup> a Little boate
to y<sup>e</sup> other side but I would not venture. There was one
Gentlewoman in our Company s<sup>d</sup> she had once been Carry’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>over on 2 mens shoulders, but they waded above their waste
in water, so I would not be for so dangerous I was sure it
was a difficult Enterprise, and when you are over y<sup>t</sup> side
they go over but such places as was pass’d before w<sup>ch</sup> Leads
to another such a water w<sup>ch</sup> some men have pass’d over and
so have gone on to a third water, but there y<sup>e</sup> Rocks hung
so Low as almost to touch y<sup>e</sup> water w<sup>ch</sup> hindred their
proceeding. That water I saw was strange, so deep and
large and look’d like a standing water but whether it were
or not Could not tell, no Doubt but it has a passage thro’
the veines of y<sup>e</sup> Earth or Else would swell so as to Cause a
bursting out of y<sup>e</sup> Earth—it seemed to have a motion w<sup>th</sup>
it, All these things shewes the great wisdom and power of
our blessed Creator to make and maintaine all things within
its own Bounds and Limits w<sup>ch</sup> have a tendency to worke
out ruine to y<sup>e</sup> whole frame of y<sup>e</sup> world if not bridled by
Gods Command.</p>

<p class='c012'>The seventh wonder is a flowing and Ebbing Well
between this town and Buxton w<sup>ch</sup> Ceases its miraculous
motion but on Great raines which Raises the springs, and
then, the man w<sup>ch</sup> was w<sup>th</sup> us told me he had seen it severall
tymes in y<sup>e</sup> winter when y<sup>e</sup> springs were high to Ebb and
flow severall tymes in a hour, w<sup>ch</sup> appear’d by y<sup>e</sup> Rise and
fall of y<sup>e</sup> water from y<sup>e</sup> Edge of ye well, and the man
seem’d to be a good sober man, M<sup>r</sup> Middleton it was, so
that its Likely when the springs are high the water from
the sea may have a quicker flux and Reflux thro’ the
Channells of y<sup>e</sup> Earth, but this is a good distance from y<sup>e</sup>
sea or Ebbing and flowing Rivers.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Castleton to Buxton is 6 mile, but they are very
long. You might go 10 of miles near London as soon as
you are going halfe so many here.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence we went to Ashburn 16 miles where I saw some
of their Copper mines where they dig them like a well, but
secure y<sup>e</sup> side w<sup>th</sup> wood and turffe bound w<sup>th</sup> ye wood like
Laths or frames aCross and long wayes to secure it. This
is a pretty neate market town; thence to Uxeter 8 mile,
and we Cross a River on a long Bridge and so we enter
Staffordshire w<sup>ch</sup> has quite a different soyle, sand and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>gravell and some Clay, and very pretty sort of pebbles in
the ground—some of a bright green like an Emerald, others
vein’d, some Clear like Christall. This Country is well
wooded and full of Enclosures, good Rich Ground, is
Extreamely differing from Darbyshire. Just before we
Came to Uxeter we pass by a very Exact house and
Gardens of one M<sup>r</sup> Cotten a justice of peace, its Brick and
Coyn’d w<sup>th</sup> stone, the Gardens or Courts very Compleate,
but it stands in a Low moorish ground to show this worlds
good is not perfect but has its foule as well as faire Side and
with all its Conveniency’s Must Labour under some
difficultyes. We pass thro’ a deep and Long water just by,
but y<sup>e</sup> bottom was hard gravell, this supply’s severall mills
w<sup>ch</sup> are used for their prepareing y<sup>e</sup> metal they take out of
y<sup>e</sup> mines. I had a piece of Copper given me by One of y<sup>e</sup>
managers of y<sup>m</sup>.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence we Came to Woolsley 7 mile, to a Relations
house S<sup>r</sup> Charles Woolsley whose Lady was my Aunt,
where we dined. Y<sup>e</sup> house stands in a fine parke; y<sup>e</sup> house
is an old building and but Low, its built round a Court:
there is a Large Lofty hall in y<sup>e</sup> Old fashion, a dineing and
drawing roome on y<sup>e</sup> one hand, and a little parlour on the
other, the best roomes were newer built w<sup>th</sup> Chambers over
them, and a very good staircase well wanscoated and
Carv’d w<sup>th</sup> good pictures. Y<sup>e</sup> Rest of the house is all old
and Low and must be new built. Y<sup>e</sup> Gardens are good,
both gravell and Green walks; there is a good River runns
by it w<sup>ch</sup> has dwarfe trees and honysuckles and binds on
the Bancks, there is a great deale of good fruite and there
are severall walks, one shady w<sup>th</sup> high trees w<sup>ch</sup> my Aunt
told me my mother liked to walke in and so was Call’d her
walke. I eate a sort of flatt strawbery like a button, w<sup>ch</sup>
grew in a second Crop from y<sup>e</sup> same strawberys Roote w<sup>ch</sup>
produces its first Crop a sort of Large garden Strawberries
and this sort afterwards. In this Country they burn all
this tyme of y<sup>e</sup> year July, their ffern and make y<sup>e</sup> ashes up
in balls and so keep to make Lye for driveing their Ruck
of Cloth’s w<sup>ch</sup> whitens them much. Not farre from hence
they have y<sup>e</sup> mines of the fine sort of Coale that is hard and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>will be pollished like black marble, for salts or boxes or such
Like, y<sup>e</sup> only difference it will not bear ye fire as marble
does, Else it resembles it very much; there were of these
mines just by but now they have Come to y<sup>e</sup> End of this
veine and so there is none within 6 or 7 mile.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is y<sup>e</sup> pitt Coale, y<sup>ts</sup> Cloven and burns Like a Candle,
and makes white ashes Like y<sup>e</sup> Scotch-Coale. Y<sup>e</sup> same
sort is in Nottinghamshire. From hence we went to Litchfield
7 mile, a sandy Road full of fine pebbles; Litchfield
stands Low, there is a greate standing water as I have seen
just by y<sup>e</sup> town, w<sup>ch</sup> does often flow y<sup>e</sup> grounds after Raines,
so the Road is secured w<sup>th</sup> a banck and a breast wall of a
good Length into y<sup>e</sup> town—as a Long Causy or bridge y<sup>e</sup>
Road is, and there are some few Arches here and there to
Carry off y<sup>e</sup> water. Y<sup>e</sup> water has very good ffish in it but
it must be muddy; its the privilege of y<sup>e</sup> Magistrates only
to have fishing or to go about it w<sup>th</sup> a little boate. The
town has good houses, y<sup>e</sup> Close has y<sup>e</sup> Bishops and Deanes
and prebends houses w<sup>ch</sup> are good; the streetes are very
neate and handsome, y<sup>e</sup> Breadth and length very well and
the building handsome. The minster is a stately structure
but old, y<sup>e</sup> outside has been finely Carv’d and full of Images
as appears by the nitches and pedistalls w<sup>ch</sup> remaine very
Close all over the walls, and still just at ye front remaines
some Statues of y<sup>e</sup> Kings of Jerusalem and some angels and
Cherubims. At y<sup>e</sup> door is a Large statue of King Charles
y<sup>e</sup> Second, and all about y<sup>e</sup> door is fine Carving of flowers
Leaves, birds and beasts and some saints and apostles
statues. The Inside of y<sup>e</sup> Church is very neate being new
but there is but Little painting; there are two Quires, one
old one w<sup>th</sup> organs and seates, y<sup>e</sup> other new w<sup>ch</sup> is very
Large w<sup>th</sup> Organs and fine Carving in y<sup>e</sup> wood; here are 2
organs. There is a painting over the Communion table of
peach Collour satten Like a Cannopy w<sup>th</sup> gold fringe, and
its drawn so well that it lookes like a Reall Cannopy.
There is some remaines of a Castle, y<sup>e</sup> walls and some of
the towers remaine. The wall that Encompasses y<sup>e</sup> town is
what Encompasses the Church and goes from thence.</p>

<p class='c012'>We went thence to Colehill 12 mile, and pass’d by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>severall good houses. Here I saw y<sup>e</sup> way of makeing
Runnet as they do in Cheshire—they take y<sup>e</sup> Reed bag and
Curd and haveing washed it Clean, salt it and breake y<sup>e</sup>
Curd small about y<sup>e</sup> bag, so drye them, being stretch’d out
with sticks like a glove, and so hang them in a Chimney
till you need it, then Cut a piece off this as big as halfe a
Crown and boyle it in a little water w<sup>ch</sup> water will turn y<sup>e</sup>
milke better than any made runnet and its freshe. This is
a pretty little market town and stands on a hill.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Coventry all on a Levell 8 mile. I Came
by severall pretty seates, one on the Left hand of S<sup>r</sup> Andrew
Hacket stands in a parke and good gardens walled in, and
on the Right hand we Came Close to a very pretty new
built house w<sup>th</sup> severall Rows of firrs, the outward Court
Came in a Compass w<sup>th</sup> open Barrgates just to the Road,
and a brick bridge from the Court at one side quite Cross
y<sup>e</sup> highway: we drove under it w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to a parke that
runs along on the other hand. The house was brick and
Coyn’d with stone and the windows the same, 8 windows
in the front and y<sup>e</sup> Lawrells and greens look’d very pretty.
Coventry stands on the side of a pretty high hill and as
you approach it from the adjacent hill you have the full
prospect. The spire and steeple of one of the Churches is
very high and is thought the third highest in England. In
the same Church yard stands another large Church w<sup>ch</sup> is
something unusuall two such great Churches together;
their towers and the Rest of y<sup>e</sup> Churches and high buildings
make the town appear very fine, the streetes are broad
and very well pitch’d w<sup>th</sup> small stone. The Cross is noted
and y<sup>e</sup> finest building in England for such a thing, and in
my phancy it very much resembles y<sup>e</sup> picture of y<sup>e</sup> tower
of Babel, its all stone Carv’d very Curiously, and there are
4 divisions Each being less than another to y<sup>e</sup> top, and so
its Piramidy forme. In Each partition is severall nitches
for statues quite round it where are kings and queens, and
just on Each side before Each statute is their arms and y<sup>e</sup>
arms of England and the arms of y<sup>e</sup> town, and so its
adorn’d w<sup>th</sup> Coullours and gilding in their proper places as
in the garments and Crowns or Coronets, and finely Carv’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>w<sup>th</sup> angels and Cherubims and all sorts of beasts, Birds,
flowers in garlands, and Leaves—this in Every division;
there is variety quite up to the top w<sup>ch</sup> is finely Carv’d
and Gilt. This is y<sup>e</sup> biggest place in y<sup>e</sup> town, and y<sup>e</sup> streete
very broad and runs off a great length, and most of y<sup>e</sup>
streetes are very good. Y<sup>e</sup> buildings are mostly of timber
work and old. There is a water house at the End of y<sup>e</sup>
town w<sup>ch</sup> from springs does supply by pipes y<sup>e</sup> whole town
w<sup>th</sup> water in y<sup>e</sup> manner that London is. There is also a
water w<sup>ch</sup> serves severall mills y<sup>t</sup> belong to the town; it
seems to be a thriveing good trading town and is very
Rich. They have a great publick stock belonging to y<sup>e</sup>
Corporation above 3 thousand pound a year for publick
schooles, Charity and y<sup>e</sup> maintenance of their severall publick
Expences, of their Magistrates and Companyes, the majority
of the heads are now in y<sup>e</sup> sober men, so its Esteem’d a
ffanatick town, and there is Indeed the largest Chapple
and y<sup>e</sup> greatest number of people I have ever seen of y<sup>e</sup>
Presbiterian way. There is another meeteing place in y<sup>e</sup>
town of y<sup>e</sup> Independants w<sup>ch</sup> is nott so bigg, but tho’ they
may differ in some small things, in y<sup>e</sup> maine they agree and
seeme to Love one another w<sup>ch</sup> was no small sattisfaction
to me, Charity and Love to y<sup>e</sup> brethren being y<sup>e</sup> Characteristicall
marke of Christs true Disciples.</p>

<p class='c012'>Coventry has one thing remains Remarkable not to be
omitted, the statue of a man Looking out of a window w<sup>th</sup>
his Eyes out, and is a monument as history tells us of some
priviledges obtein’d by a Lady wife, to the nobleman who
was lord of y<sup>e</sup> town, and she was to purchase them by
passing on horse back through y<sup>e</sup> town naked w<sup>ch</sup> he
thought she would not do, but out of zeale to relieve y<sup>e</sup>
town from some hard bondage she did, and Commanded
all windows and doores to be shutt and none to appear in
the streete on pain of death w<sup>ch</sup> was obey’d by all; but one
man would open a window and Looke out and for his
impudence had this judgment on him to be struck blind;
this statute is his resemblance and one day in a year they
Remember y<sup>e</sup> good Lady by some rejoyceing. There are
severall good walks about y<sup>e</sup> town, and a large parke above
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>y<sup>e</sup> town w<sup>ch</sup> most people walk in: thence we went to Warwick.
Coventry is joyn’d to Litchfield under one Bishop
and y<sup>t</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> I wonder at that the Bishop and most of y<sup>e</sup>
dignatorys and abundance of Gentry Rather Chooses to
Live at and near all about Litchfield tho’ it stands so low
and waterish, than at Coventry w<sup>ch</sup> is a pleasanter scituation
and better buildings. There is S<sup>r</sup> Tho: Nortons house at
y<sup>e</sup> end of y<sup>e</sup> town and a large parke. From Coventry to
Warwick going about to see an acquaintance of our Company
we made it 10 mile, and went in sight of y<sup>e</sup> Lord
Liegh on y<sup>e</sup> Left hand, w<sup>ch</sup> Lay all along by y<sup>e</sup> River Aven;
it stands Low very well wooded.</p>

<p class='c012'>We ascended a very steep hill to take a view of y<sup>e</sup>
Country and so Could see Coventry, and were just by
Hillingworth Castle on y<sup>e</sup> Right hand—much of y<sup>e</sup> Ruines
of y<sup>e</sup> walls remaine still—and so Enter Warwickshire. The
town of Warwick by means of a sad fire about 4 or 5 years
since y<sup>t</sup> Laid y<sup>e</sup> greatest part in ashes, its most now new
built, w<sup>ch</sup> is w<sup>th</sup> brick and Coyn’d w<sup>th</sup> stone and y<sup>e</sup> windows
y<sup>e</sup> same. There still remaines some few houses of y<sup>e</sup> old
town w<sup>ch</sup> are all built of stone. Ye streetes are very handsome
and y<sup>e</sup> buildings Regular and fine, not very Lofty
being Limited by act of partliam<sup>t</sup> to such a pitch and size
to build y<sup>e</sup> town. Y<sup>e</sup> ruines of y<sup>e</sup> Church still remaines, y<sup>e</sup>
repairing of which is y<sup>e</sup> next worke design’d; Y<sup>e</sup> Chancell
stands still in w<sup>ch</sup> was all the fine monuments y<sup>t</sup> were preserv’d
from the fire; there is one monument of y<sup>e</sup> great
Earle of Leisters and his Ladyes in stone Curiously
wrought, w<sup>th</sup> their Garments, and painted and Gilded.
There is another in marble of y<sup>e</sup> Earle of Warwick, y<sup>e</sup> statue
Cut very finely, y<sup>e</sup> face hands and forme very Lively, and
under his head is a Role of Straw matting as you would
suppose being Exceeding naturall Cut in Stone. In y<sup>e</sup>
middle stands y<sup>e</sup> monument of y<sup>e</sup> Earle y<sup>t</sup> was regent in
Ffrance and dyed there and was brought and buried here,
his statue at Length in armour, but y<sup>e</sup> Lines of his face and
hands w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> veines and sinews were so finely Cast and y<sup>e</sup>
very aire of his Countenance much to y<sup>e</sup> Life or Like a
Liveing man all Cast brass and Burnish’d very delicately y<sup>t</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>it Looks like Gold, all his armour very Exact and his arms
are Cut finely at his head, and supporters at his feete, w<sup>th</sup>
ffigures and Images to adorne it; round the tombstone on
y<sup>e</sup> one side and Each End is 4 : and 2 y—at the End
statues of y<sup>e</sup> great men y<sup>t</sup> were of his family, sons and
Grand-Children, and on the other side are 4 Ladies of the
family all Cast in the same Burnish’d Brass; they are in
little and all in Religious habits w<sup>ch</sup> formerly in ye tymes of
popery and superstition most persons Coveted to dye in;
their garments are folded in differing shapes and w<sup>th</sup> many
wrinklings and gathers w<sup>ch</sup> is very exact and y<sup>e</sup> more to be
noted being all in such a stiff mettle as Brass and yet it
Lookes Easye and natural. On y<sup>e</sup> other side y<sup>e</sup> Church in
a little Chapple is a Large monument of Black and White
Marble in manner of a bed w<sup>th</sup> pillars, and its grated round—the
pillars black marble—of some Nobleman w<sup>th</sup> a Large
Inscription round it, and one thing is noted of him there
that he thought it his greatest Character to be Esteem’d a
great ffriend and Companion of S<sup>r</sup> Philip Sidney’s w<sup>ch</sup> is but
of poor availe to him now dead if he was not y<sup>e</sup> friend of y<sup>e</sup>
great Jehovah—but such is y<sup>e</sup> folly and vanity of y<sup>e</sup> most of
y<sup>e</sup> world to be in Esteeme w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> wise and great men of
this world. There is delicate Carving about y<sup>e</sup> walls and
round y<sup>e</sup> windows in stone all manner of Birds beasts,
Laurells flowers &amp;c &amp;c, and Cherubims, and Gilded and
painted in severall parts. Warwick Castle is a stately
building, its now the Lord Brooke’s house. You Enter thro’
two Large Courts into a noble Hall wanscoated, w<sup>th</sup> in it is
a Large parlour all wanscoated w<sup>th</sup> Cedar, w<sup>ch</sup> is full of fine
pictures of the family and beyond that is a drawing roome
and bed Chamber w<sup>th</sup> good tapistry hangings; they are old
but so good worke and so beautifull the Coullours still, you
would admire it, and the worke so Curious all of silk that y<sup>e</sup>
very postures and faces Look Extreame lively and naturall,
and the groves streames and Rivers Look’s very well on it.
There was good velvet Chaires in y<sup>e</sup> roomes and good
Pictures. Within y<sup>e</sup> bed Chamber is Closets, out of one you
Looke to y<sup>e</sup> river even at y<sup>e</sup> End window, there is so greate
a Levell you may see near 20 mile. Stowe in y<sup>e</sup> Old you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>see w<sup>ch</sup> is as farre, its all full of Enclosures and woods most
of the Country. All these roomes are very Lofty and large
and larger than most houses I have seen, the Gardens fine
and many without Each other, w<sup>th</sup> good gravell and grass
walks, squares of dwarfe trees of all sorts and steps to
descend from one walke to another, y<sup>e</sup> whole of w<sup>ch</sup> I saw at
one view on y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup> mount, together with y<sup>e</sup> whole town
and a vast prospect all about, y<sup>e</sup> mount being very high and
y<sup>e</sup> ascent is round to an agen securred by Cut hedges on
y<sup>e</sup> side y<sup>e</sup> path. At y<sup>e</sup> Entrance of y<sup>e</sup> first Court y<sup>e</sup> porter
diverts you w<sup>th</sup> a history of Guy Earle of Warwick, there is
his walking staff 9 foote long and y<sup>e</sup> staff of a Gyant w<sup>ch</sup> he
kill’d thats 12 ffoote long; his sword, Helmet and shield
and breast and back all of a prodigious size, as is his wives
jron slippers and also his horses armour and the pottage-pott
for his supper—it was a yard over the top; there is also
the bones of severall Beasts he kill’d, the Rib of y<sup>e</sup> Dun-Cow
as bigg as halfe a great Cart Wheele: 2 miles from
the town is his Cave dugg out by his own hands just y<sup>e</sup>
dimention of his body as the Common people say, there is
also his will Cut out on stone, but y<sup>e</sup> letters are much
defaced; these are the storyes and meer ffiction, for the true
history of Guy was that he was but a Little man in stature
tho’ great in mind and valour, which tradition describes to
posterity by being a Gyant. Such will the account be of
our Hero King William the third tho’ Little in stature yet
Great in atchievements and valour. Ffrom Warwick we
went towards Daventry all along part of the vale of y<sup>e</sup> Red
horse w<sup>ch</sup> was very heavy way, and Could not reach thither
being 14 mile. About 11 mile we Came to a place Called
Nether Sugar—a sad village, we Could have no Entertainment.
Just by it on the top of a steep hill is Shuggbery
Hall a seate of S<sup>r</sup> Charles Shuggberys who seeing our
distress being just night and y<sup>e</sup> horses weary w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> heavy
way he very Curteously tooke Compassion on us and treated
us very handsomely that night, a good supper serv’d in
plaite and very good wine and good beds. My Lady
Shuggbery was the lord Leigh’s Daughter and that day
dineing there her Coach drove by us when in distress Enquireing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>for Lodging w<sup>ch</sup> Caused S<sup>r</sup> Charles to Come out to
meete us, shewed a generous hospitable spirit to strangers,
and with a great deale of good humour My Lady Entertained
us. The house stands within a good parke, the deer so
tame as to Come up near y<sup>e</sup> gate w<sup>ch</sup> ascends steps to a
Court of Broad stone. The house looks very handsome
built of Brick and Stone, good hall and large parlour and
drawing roome well wanscoated, neately ffurnish’d and a little
parlour on the other side with good pictures; the Butlery
Kitchen and offices very Convenient, two good staircases and
3 or 4 good Chambers very well ffurnish’d tho’ not very
Rich; but in the Generall all things were very well as any
private Gentleman has whatever. he has severall good
houses. He ordered one of his Daughters to get me a
Curiosity they dig up in most part of the hill there about,
they Call them Arms, its just Like Mullets that they have in
an Eschuteon to difference the third son from the first and
second in a family. Thence we went to Daventry 3 miles, a
pretty large Market town and good houses all of stone and so
we Enter into Northamptonshire. To Northampton town is
8 mile w<sup>ch</sup> opens a noble prospect to y<sup>e</sup> sight a mile distant, a
large town well built, y<sup>e</sup> streetes as large as most in London
Except Holborn and the Strand, the houses well built of
brick and stone, some all stone, very regular buildings.</p>

<p class='c012'>The town hall is new built all stone and resembles Guildhall
in Little tho’ it is a good Lofty spacious place. There
is two Barrs in it w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> benches and seat distinct, over one
of the Barrs is King William and Queen Mary’s pictures at
Length. The Church is new built, its very neate, there is
two Rows of stone pillars at the Entrance of the Church on
y<sup>e</sup> outside, and it is to be paved w<sup>th</sup> broad stone but y<sup>t</sup> was
not quite ffinished, they were at worke on some adornments
at the ffront. There is abundance of new buildings which
adds to the beauty of y<sup>e</sup> town. We enter the town from
Daventry over a large Bridge, and the water runs twineing
about y<sup>e</sup> grounds w<sup>th</sup> rows of Willows on Each side of it
w<sup>ch</sup> looks very pretty.</p>

<p class='c012'>Y<sup>e</sup> way out of town towards London you go by a Cross
a mile off the town Call’d High-Cross, it stands just in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>middle of England, its all stone 12 stepps w<sup>ch</sup> runs round it,
above that is the stone Carv’d ffinely and there are 4 Large
Nitches about y<sup>e</sup> Middle, in Each is the statue of some
queen at Length which Encompasses it w<sup>th</sup> other Carvings
as garnish, and so it rises less and less to y<sup>e</sup> top like a tower
or Piramidy. Thence to Stony Stratford, so Cross y<sup>e</sup> river
Aven again 12 mile, and Enter Buckinghamshire. At
Stony Stratford w<sup>ch</sup> is a little place built of stone they make
a great deale of bonelace and so they do all here about, its
the manuffactory of this part of y<sup>e</sup> Country, they sit and
worke all along y<sup>e</sup> streete as thick as Can be.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to great Horwood: this Country is fruitfull, full
of woods, Enclosures and rich Ground. Y<sup>e</sup> Little towns
stand pretty thicke. You have many in view as you pass y<sup>e</sup>
Road. 6 mile to Horwood, thence we pass by a lofty pile
of Building Called Salden, a gentlemans house, and by the
Rich M<sup>rs</sup> Bennets House, Remarkable for Coveteousness
w<sup>ch</sup> was y<sup>e</sup> Cause of her death—her treasures tempted a
Butcher to Cut her throate who hangs in Chains just
against her house. She had 3 daughters, the two youngest
are Living one married to a Benet, y<sup>e</sup> other y<sup>e</sup> Earle of
Salisbury and are great fortunes by their mothers penuriousness.
Thence to Oxborn and Enter Bedfordshire 13 mile.
The duke of Bedfords house we saw w<sup>ch</sup> stands in a fine
parke full of deer and wood, and some off the trees are kept
Cut in works and y<sup>e</sup> shape of severall beasts. The house is
an old Building, Low, there are very good stables and out
offices, Landry yard &amp;c. The gardens are fine, there is a
Large bowling-green with 8 arbours kept Cut neately and
seates in Each, there is a Seate up in a high tree that
ascends from y<sup>e</sup> green 50 steps that Commands the whole
parke round to see the Deer hunted, as also a Large
prospect of the Country. There are 3 Large Gardens, fine
Gravell walks and full of fruite. I Eate a great quantety
of y<sup>e</sup> Red Coralina goosbery w<sup>ch</sup> is a large thin skin’d sweete
Goosebery. Ye walks are one above another w<sup>th</sup> stone
steps. In the square, just by the dineing roome window is
all sorts of pots of flowers and Curious greens, fine orange,
Cittron and Lemon trees and mirtles, striped ffilleroy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>y<sup>e</sup> fine aloes plant. On the side of this you pass under an
arch into a Cherry garden in the midst of w<sup>ch</sup> stands a
figure of stone resembling an old weeder woman used in the
garden, and my Lord would have her Effigie w<sup>ch</sup> is done so
like and her Clothes so well that at first I tooke it to be a
Real Living body. On y<sup>e</sup> other side of y<sup>e</sup> house is another
Large garden, severall gravell walks one above another, and
on the flatts are fish ponds the whole length of the Walke;
above y<sup>t</sup> in the next flat is 2 fish ponds, here are dwarfe
trees spread of a great bigness. Ffrom thence we Came to
Dunstable 7 mile over a sad road Called Hockley in y<sup>e</sup> Hole,
as full of deep slows in y<sup>e</sup> winter it must be Empasable.
There is a very good pitch’d Causey for foote people and
horse, that is raised up high from the Road, and a very
steepe Chaulky hill, from whence it has its name—the
Chalk hill just as you Enter Dunstable. Its a good town
as you shall meete with on the Road, its full of Inns, there
is a long Large streete with a great water in the streete—it
Looks like a Large pond. Here I went to see two of my
Relations Daughters to S<sup>r</sup> Charles Woolsley, one marry’d
there to a Doctor of physick D<sup>r</sup> Marsh, w<sup>th</sup> whome was a
maiden sister my Cos’n Bridget Woolsley. Thence to S<sup>t</sup>
Albans and so we Enter Hartfordshire 12 mile. There is a
very large streete to the Market place, its a pretty Large
town takeing all the S<sup>t</sup> Juliers and y<sup>t</sup> at one End, and y<sup>e</sup>
other End is S<sup>t</sup> Nicholas where is a handsome Church.
The great Church w<sup>ch</sup> is dedicated to S<sup>t</sup> Albans is much out
of repaire, I see the places in the pavement that was worn
like holes for kneeling by the devotes of y<sup>e</sup> Religion and
his votery’s as they tell you, but the whole Church is so
worn away that it mourns for some Charitable person to
help repaire it. There are severall good houses about y<sup>e</sup>
town, one of y<sup>e</sup> Earle off Maulberough (now Duke of Marlborough)
and one of M<sup>rs</sup> Gennings y<sup>e</sup> Countess Mother.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence we Came to Barnet 8 mile, w<sup>ch</sup> is in Middlesex
and seemes to be a very sharpe aire; its a Large place and
y<sup>e</sup> houses are made Commodious to Entertain the Company
y<sup>t</sup> Comes to drink the water, w<sup>ch</sup> Certainly if they be at the
paines to go once and see would have but Little stomach to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>drink them. The well is a Large place walled in 8 square,
its at Least two yards over and built 2 or 3 yards up from
the water and over it is Lattices of wood round to Looke
down into it and so Covered like a house above; below are
staires down to a doore to go in to dip the water there. I
stood at the Lowest step above the water to Look into it,
its full of Leaves and Dirt and Every tyme they dip it
troubles y<sup>e</sup> water, not but what they take up and let stand—Looks
Clear but I Could not taste it. Its very deep and
not done at the bottom w<sup>th</sup> a bason as Tunbridg, neither
Can you see the bottom, so that it appears not to be a quick
spring as Tunbridg or y<sup>e</sup> Spaw or Hamstead waters w<sup>ch</sup>
have all fine stone basons in w<sup>ch</sup> you see the springs bubble
up as fast and by a pipe runs off as Clear and fast; it more
resembles Epsom for w<sup>ch</sup> reason I dislike that. Thence to
Highgate 6 miles, thence to London 4 miles where I
returned and all our Company Blessed be God very well
w<sup>th</sup> out any disaster or trouble in 7 weeks tyme about 635
miles that we went together.</p>

<p class='c012'>My Journey to Canterberry and Dover in Kent the same
year from Amwell in Hartfordshire. I went to Royston
1 mile, and Epin in Essex 9 mile, thence to Drumford
through Lanes and much wood—that part of Essex is full
of woods; y<sup>t</sup> was 10 mile. Thence to Abnife 14 mile,
thence to Tilbery 3 mile w<sup>ch</sup> is a ffine ffort, a great flatt to
y<sup>e</sup> Land, full of Watry ditches and may be flooded all over.
Here was the fight by y<sup>e</sup> parliament in 1640. There are
Severall Buildings by themselves of a Triangular form of
Brickwork in w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup> powder and amunition is kept. Here
is a ferry over to Gravesend where we enter Kent, w<sup>ch</sup> Lyes
just over against it a little snugg town under a hill, the
houses little and thick together fitt only for seamen and
soldiers y<sup>t</sup> are Employ’d in the water or the ffort. I saw
severall Colliers pass by Laden towards London.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Thames here is very Rough and Deep so as we fferry
over in a boate like a Hoy. Thence I went to Rochester
7 mile most in lanes; we Enter the town over the Medway
w<sup>ch</sup> is the finest River I ever saw, it runs thence to the sea
and meetes y<sup>e</sup> Thames at y<sup>e</sup> Boy in Nore and so they fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>into y<sup>e</sup> sea together, but it Ebbs and flows up a great way
above Rochester and is very salt. The Bridg at Rochester
is the finest in England—nay its said to Equal any in the
world—it is not built upon w<sup>th</sup> houses as London Bridge
but its very Long and fine, Iron spikes Like a grate is on
the top of the wall w<sup>ch</sup> is breast high, and these jrons on the
top w<sup>ch</sup> are above a yard more. Its jndented at Each arch
as all bridges are, there are 9 large Arches w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> middle
one w<sup>ch</sup> is to be opened by drawing up to give passage to
Barges and little vessells. When y<sup>e</sup> tyde was out I saw the
worke of the arches is w<sup>th</sup> wood Cutt hollow, and stands a
good distance into the water to keep the water from bearing
too hard against the Bridge.</p>

<p class='c012'>The town is large jncludeing the suburbs and all, for
there is a large place before you pass the river w<sup>ch</sup> washes
quite round y<sup>t</sup> side of y<sup>e</sup> town to y<sup>e</sup> Dockyards, thats a mile
from it where are two large yards for building shipps.</p>

<p class='c012'>I saw severall Large shipps building, others refitting.
There was in one place a sort of arches like a bridge of
Brickwork, they told me y<sup>e</sup> use of it was to let in y<sup>e</sup> water
there, and so they put their masts in to season, besides this
dock, here are severall streetes of houses on this hill w<sup>ch</sup> is
pretty high and is just against Rochester, and on y<sup>e</sup> hill you
have y<sup>e</sup> best prospect of the town and see y<sup>e</sup> severall good
Churches in it, and the Castle w<sup>ch</sup> is a pretty Little thing
just by y<sup>e</sup> Medway w<sup>ch</sup> runs along by it, and so at foote of
this hill is a Round and so onward to sea. There were
severall shipps at anchor along y<sup>e</sup> River. All behind the
town is another hill w<sup>ch</sup> is covered w<sup>th</sup> fine woods y<sup>t</sup> Looks
very fine; thence to Sittingburn 11 mile all in sight of y<sup>e</sup>
Lovely Medway. This is a very good town for y<sup>e</sup> Road and
travellers as you shall meete w<sup>th</sup>. The Church is all built
w<sup>th</sup> flints headed so Curiously that it Lookes like glass and
shines with y<sup>e</sup> suns Reflexion.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Canterbery 16 mile, we pass by great Hop
yards on both sides of the Road, and this year was great
quantetyes of that fruite here in Kent. We pass by
Ffeversham just at y<sup>e</sup> towns End w<sup>ch</sup> is 9 mile from Canterbury,
its a very large town and good buildings of Bricke.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Canterbery opens to view 6 miles distant by y<sup>e</sup> advantage
of a high hill we pass over to it—its a noble Citty—y<sup>e</sup> gates
are high tho’ but narrow, the streetes are most of them
Large and long, and y<sup>e</sup> buildings handsome, very neate but
not very Lofty, most are of Brickwork, its a flourishing
town, good tradeing in y<sup>e</sup> weaving of silks. I saw 20
Loomes in one house w<sup>th</sup> severall fine flower’d silks, very
good ones, and its a very Ingenious art to fix the warps and
Chaine in their Loomes to Cast their work into such
ffigures and flowers. There stands a boy by Every Loome
and pulls up and down threads w<sup>ch</sup> are fastened to the
weaving, and so pulls the Chaine to the Exact form for y<sup>e</sup>
shuttle to work through.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are also paper mills w<sup>ch</sup> dispatches paper at a quick
rate, they were then makeing brown paper w<sup>n</sup> I saw it.
The mill is set agoing by y<sup>e</sup> water and at y<sup>e</sup> same tyme it
pounded the raggs to morter for y<sup>e</sup> paper, and it beate out
meale and Hemp and ground bread altogether—that is at
y<sup>e</sup> same tyme. When y<sup>e</sup> substance for y<sup>e</sup> paper is pounded
Enough, they take it in a great tub and so with a frame
just of y<sup>e</sup> size of y<sup>e</sup> sheetes of paper made all of small wire
just as I have seen fine Screens to Screen Corne in, only this
is much Closer wrought, and they Clap a frame of wood
round y<sup>e</sup> Edge and so dip it into y<sup>e</sup> tub and what is too
thinn runs through; then they turn this frame down on a
piece of Coarse woollen just of y<sup>e</sup> size of y<sup>e</sup> paper and so
give a Knock to it and it falls off; on w<sup>ch</sup> they Clap another
such a piece of woollen Cloth w<sup>ch</sup> is ready to Lay y<sup>e</sup> next
frame of paper, and so till they have made a large heape
w<sup>ch</sup> they by a board on the bottom move to a press, and so
Lay a board on y<sup>e</sup> top and so Let down a great screw and
weight on it, w<sup>ch</sup> they force together into such a narrow
Compass as they know so many sheets of paper will be
reduced, and this presses out all y<sup>e</sup> thinner part and Leaves
the paper so firme as it may be taken up sheete by sheete
and Laid together to be thoroughly dryed by the wind.
They told me white paper was made in the same manner
only they must take white woollen to put between. There
is a great number of French people in this town w<sup>ch</sup> are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Employ’d in the weaving and silk winding, I meete them
Every night going home in great Companyes, but then
some of them were Employ’d in the Hopping, it being the
season for pulling them. Here is a spring in the town that
is dranke by many persons as Tunbridge and approv’d by
them, but others find it an ill water, one Gentleman in y<sup>e</sup>
same house I was in Complained of a numbness in his
Limbs after drinking it sometyme, w<sup>ch</sup> is quite Contrary to
Tunbridge waters whose property is to relieve Lost Limbs
y<sup>t</sup> are benumbed, and it Comeing from steele should have y<sup>t</sup>
Effect it raising the blood and gives it a new Circulation.
The taste of the spring in this town seems to be from a
mixt soyle and bears a Likeness to y<sup>e</sup> Sulpher spaw
Epsome and y<sup>e</sup> Iron springs too w<sup>ch</sup> are at Tunbridge;
what its operation is I Cannot tell only tasteing halfe a Glass
of it w<sup>ch</sup> I did not Like. Y<sup>e</sup> well is walled in and a raile
round w<sup>th</sup> stepps down and paved aboute for the Company
to stand just at y<sup>e</sup> head to drinke, but I like no spring y<sup>t</sup>
rises not quick and runs off apace that must have most
spirit and good off the minerall it Comes from. There is
fine walks and seates and places for the musick to make it
acceptable and Comodious to y<sup>e</sup> Company. There is a
large Market house and a town Hall over it in the town,
but the Cathedrall is the finest sight there, the Carving of
stone is very fine on the outside as also within, but its not
so Large as Salisbury; its a square tower—no spire running
up from it—but the small ones at Each Corner of y<sup>e</sup> tower
for ornament.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are two large jsles in y<sup>e</sup> middle of the Church w<sup>ch</sup>
leads to open gates of jron barrs and spikes, thence is an
ascent of 20 steps, as Winchester Church is; up to y<sup>e</sup> Quire,
where is a fine Large organ, so is the ffont well Carv’d and
painted and Gilded, the bottom is white and grey Marble
w<sup>th</sup> white marble statues round the stem to the ffoote, the
top is made in a piramidy Carv’d and painted. The
Windows in y<sup>e</sup> Quire are most delicately painted as Ever I
saw, y<sup>e</sup> Curiosity of the worke and Coullours beyond others,
but the size of the windows much Inferior being very small
for a Church. Y<sup>e</sup> Glass is very thick and the Coullours Laid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>on it strikes through the glass, its Coullours tinctures all y<sup>e</sup>
Glass, an art w<sup>ch</sup> now is lost amongst us. At y<sup>e</sup> Alter is a
Cloth and Coushons of purple ffigured Velvet the books the
same, there is a broad tissue border of orrace work gold and
silver, and at y<sup>e</sup> Edge is a ffine knotted fringe of purple silk
and gold. The Bishops seate and Cushon the same w<sup>ch</sup> was
given by our good Queen Mary King Williams Queen when
she was at Canterbery. The Chapter house is pretty Lofty
supported by its own worke w<sup>th</sup> out pillars, its Ceiled with
Irish oake, there are severall good monuments of y<sup>e</sup> Kings
and queens and great men and severall Bishops. There is
one Bishops statue y<sup>t</sup> was at y<sup>e</sup> paines to divide the Bible
into Chapters w<sup>ch</sup> makes it more Commodious to the
Reader, and was a good Employment for him it being the
proper subject of such a person of y<sup>e</sup> Church to studdy y<sup>e</sup>
holy Scriptures w<sup>ch</sup> gives the truest wisdom. There is the
Chaire that all y<sup>e</sup> Arch Bishops are Inaugurated in when
made Arch Bishops, its wood with Elbows. There is
another statue of a Bishop Cut out in wood, his Robes and
all well Carv’d and is ffirm and solid still, Except some
small deffaceing by y<sup>e</sup> soldiers in y<sup>e</sup> warre tyme, and this
has stood some 100 of yeares. There is a Chapple Called
Thomas of Beckets Crown, the Roofe being Carv’d in the
fform of a Crown and painted; there is also a pavement
w<sup>ch</sup> is much worne by the feete and knees off this S<sup>ts</sup>
votarys that Came to do obeysance to his Shrine. There
is one Brass statue in armour but its not so bright being
less regarded than that at Warwick. Under the Cathedrall
is a Large Church just Like S<sup>t</sup> Ffaiths under S<sup>t</sup> Pauls in
London; this is given to the Ffrench protestants in the
town for the worshipping God, it holds a vast number of
people, its as full of Seates as Can thrust by Each other,
it seemed a Little darkish, but they say when the doores are
open its Light Enough, its so well arch’d that they Cannot
hear them in the Cathedrall when singing—at least no
wayes to disturb them. I went out another part of the
town thro’ a good gate and so to Dover 15 mile much up
hill and down, it was a good Road and Sort of Champion
Country, yet at a distance you see many good woods and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>pretty houses w<sup>th</sup> Rows of trees. The Castle at Dover is
discover’d five mile off standing on the Edge of a very
steep hill on w<sup>ch</sup> you ascend up to y<sup>e</sup> tower 120 steps up,
whence you discover Callice in Ffrance. I saw the Clifts
and hills plaine, but in some Cleer dayes towards the
Evening you may see the towers and buildings of Callice,
you likewise see a vast way on all sides sea ward and to y<sup>e</sup>
Land. The Castle is Left much to decay and ruinated only
a small appartment for the Governour of three or four
Roomes, Else y<sup>e</sup> whole is spoyl’d the floores taken up and
wanscoate pulled down. I was in the roome Queen
Elizabeth was kept prisoner in till the death of queen
Mary, the balcony just by in w<sup>ch</sup> she saw the messenger
Coming which she supposed was of Death to take off her
head, but proved the Messenger that brought y<sup>e</sup> news of
the Crown and Kingdom falling to her by the death of her
sister. She afterwards repaired the Chapple but now its
quite out of use, the Roofe and side being Mouldred
down in many places. There is a fine dry well in y<sup>e</sup> Castle
walled Curiously of a vast depth, the use of it was to
Discover the work of the miners in tyme of a siege whereabout
they were at worke, going down into this well discovered
y<sup>e</sup> working by y<sup>e</sup> shakeing y<sup>e</sup> Earth at what side
they were at worke, and so might defeate them by a
Countermine. There is also a great well of 60 ffathom
deep, the water is drawn up by a great wheele with a horse,
notwithstanding its so deep yet its also wide and Exactly
down Right, that I could see the water at the top, and when
I flung a stone w<sup>ch</sup> was a pretty while descending I saw
when it plashed into y<sup>e</sup> water. There is on y<sup>e</sup> Plattform
guns mounted w<sup>ch</sup> being so high Commands the Road so as
no ship Durst saile under it. Its a mighty steep Clift at
the poynt which makes ones head Giddy to Look down to
the sea. There is one Gun of Cast Brass of a Great Length
finely Carv’d and adorn’d with ffigures, this Carrys a Ball
a great way tho’ y<sup>e</sup> bore or muzzle of y<sup>e</sup> Gun be not bigger
than my fist, so the Ball its Charged with Cannot be very
bigg but it will do Execution a great way off; this was
made at Utriche in Holland and presented to Queen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>Elizabeth; its worth a great sum of money for its Curiosity.
There is a Little Cannon of y<sup>e</sup> same worke w<sup>ch</sup> I have seen
in y<sup>e</sup> Tower at London, there is a great Inscription on it.
There are Gunns also planted in a Little ffort at y<sup>e</sup> ffoote
of this steepe Clift to secure y<sup>e</sup> Road from Pirates, for as to
Dover town it Looks like a place of no deffence, its a Little
place, y<sup>e</sup> houses are Little and looks thrust together, there
is a market house and town hall, its well enough for the
accomodation of the seamen and to Supply the shipps w<sup>th</sup>
anything, it seems where the town stands the sea formerly
Came in and was Cover’d under water severall fathom
deep so as the shipps Ride there in harbour. The town
was only within the Limits of a wall w<sup>ch</sup> Encompass’s y<sup>e</sup>
Castle of which small matters appears, only of a great Banck
and some parts of y<sup>e</sup> Ruines of y<sup>e</sup> ffoundation, but y<sup>e</sup> sea
Leaving the shore so ffarre they have built this town w<sup>ch</sup>
has no gates.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence we went to Deale 7 mile, all by the sea side w<sup>ch</sup>
is Called the Downs w<sup>ch</sup> sometymes is full of shipps all
along the Road, but now there were not many. The
Downes seems to be so open a place and the shoar so
Easye for Landing I should think it no difficulty to Land a
good army of men in a little tyme, there is only 3 Little
fforts, or Castles they Call them, about a miles distance one
to another—Warworth at Deal, and Sandwitch which
holds a few Guns, but I should think they would be of
Little Effect and give the Enemy no great trouble. Deale
Looks like a good thriveing place, y<sup>e</sup> buildings new and neate
Brickwork with gardens. I believe they are most masters
of shipps houses and seamen or Else those that belong to
y<sup>e</sup> Cordage and Saile makeing with other Requisites to
shipping. All this Country about seemes to be a very fruitfull
soyle and full of woods. You see a many pretty towns
altogether almost, neate Churches and towers all the way
you travell from Dover to Deale on y<sup>r</sup> Left hand, but beyond
Deale you go a very deepe heavy sand for 4 mile to Sandwich.
You go along by y<sup>e</sup> Sea side in sight of the jsle of
Thannet w<sup>ch</sup> is just over against Sandwich and is so near
it you see y<sup>e</sup> Lands and jnclosures and woods and houses.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>I suppose it not a quarter of a League from Sandwich;
this is a sad old town all timber building, you Enter by a
gate and so you go out of it by a gate, but its run so to
Decay that Except one or two good houses its just like to
Drop down y<sup>e</sup> whole town.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Canterbery ten mile most thro’ Lanes. We
come by my Lord Winchelseas house, garden and parke.
Y<sup>e</sup> house is an old building—and so I Entered Canterbery
another way through another gate and observ’d all wayes
to y<sup>e</sup> town—being from hills gives the prospect of y<sup>e</sup> town
very finely to the Eye and Indeed it Lookes like a good
Citty altogether which way Ever you Looke on it in the
approach. From thence to Maidstone I went 9 mile back
the way I Came, and on the hill 6 mile off w<sup>ch</sup> gave me so
fine a sight of Canterbery as I came, did Likewise present
a pleaseing prospect as I returned; it being a very high
hill Commands the view of the Country a vast way and w<sup>th</sup>
such variety of woods rivers and Inclosures and buildings
that was very delicate and diverting. When I turned off
the road to Maidstone I travell’d through Lanes and woods
w<sup>ch</sup> were very ffine but hid y<sup>e</sup> sight of the Country about
being so Close; y<sup>t</sup> it was y<sup>e</sup> privatest Road I have travell’d.
About 10 mile short of Maidstone you ascend a very steep
hill w<sup>ch</sup> discovers the whole Country at one view 40 mile
off backward from whence we Came; and a few paces on
the top of y<sup>e</sup> hill the descent of the hill on that other side
is so great a fall that gives you as full a discovery of the
Country all forward, both w<sup>ch</sup> shew the variety of grounds
intermixt w<sup>th</sup> Each other, and Lesser hills and plaines and
Rivers w<sup>ch</sup> such advanced grounds present y<sup>e</sup> travellers at
one view; this is Called Boxlye hills and is part of the
same Ridge of hills w<sup>ch</sup> runs along by Epsome.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Canterbery its 30 mile to Maidstone. Maidstone
town is a very neate market town as you shall see in the
Country, its buildings are mostly of timber worke, the
streetes are Large. The Market Cross runs down in the
middle of the greate streete a good way, there being
three divisions in it, one good Cross for fruite, another for
Corne, and another for all sorts of things, 2 of which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>built over for the town hall and publick use. There is also
a Large Gail. This streete notwithstanding the hall and
Cross stands in the midst, is yet a good breadth on Each
side and when it Comes to meete in one, is very broad and
runs down a great Length quite to the bridge Cross the
Medway which is not very broad here, yet it beares Barges
that bring up burdens to the town: it seemes to divide the
town for beyond the Bridge are buildings, whole streetes
w<sup>ch</sup> runs along y<sup>e</sup> river. There are very pretty houses
about the town, looks like the habitation of Rich men. I
believe its a wealthy place, there are severall pretty streetes.
This was Market day being Thursday and it seemed to be
well furnish’d w<sup>th</sup> all sorts of Commodityes and I observed
there was great quantety’s of Leather but Could not Learn
what particular thing that was their staple Comodity or
tradeing in, but in Generall it seemed to be like a Little
faire for the variety of wares tho’ they told me that was not
so full a Market as some dayes because the Country people
were taken up aboute their hopping so Could not bring
things to Market. Thence to Rochester 8 mile, I came by
a great many ffine hopp yards where they were at work
pulling y<sup>e</sup> hopps. I came into Rochester at the other side,
thro’ the wood on the hill I mentioned before, from whence
the town and y<sup>e</sup> dock yards washed by the Medway, with
the shipps at anchor was as acceptable a prospect and
diverting as was y<sup>e</sup> other on the other side. I went through
y<sup>e</sup> town just by the great Church w<sup>ch</sup> is a good building
but nothing Curious: also I went by y<sup>e</sup> Castle wall w<sup>ch</sup> is
but small what remaines of it; thence over the ffine bridge,
and as I travell’d all along in sight of the Medway to
Rochester, so Next day I went in sight of the Thames. I
went that night to Gravesend w<sup>ch</sup> is all by the side of
Cherry grounds that are of severall acres of ground, and
Runs quite down to the Thames w<sup>ch</sup> is Convenient for to
Convey the Cherrys to London, for here the Great produce
of that fruite is w<sup>ch</sup> supplyes y<sup>e</sup> town and Country with y<sup>e</sup>
Kentish Cherrys, a good sort Fflemish fruite. I went 2 mile
beyond Gravesend w<sup>ch</sup> made it in miles 9 from Rochester,
to a Little place Called Northfleete, its much in the woods.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>Thence I went to Dartfford 6 mile a little neate town;
thence to Shutershill 2 mile on the top of w<sup>ch</sup> hill you see
a vast prospect Exactly Round it, being a great height of
ground and such a descent Every way that Commands the
sight of a vast tract of ground, w<sup>ch</sup> appeares in y<sup>e</sup> greatest
variety—some Lands Clothed w<sup>th</sup> trees, others with grass
and flowers, gardens orchards w<sup>th</sup> all sorts of Herbage and
tillage, w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> severall Little towns all by y<sup>e</sup> river Eariff,
Leigh, Woolwich &amp;c, quite up to London, Greenwitch,
Deadford, Blackwall—the Thames twisting and turning
itself up and down bearing severall vessells and men of
warre on it, and some under saile. On this part of the River
I have seen 100 saile of shipps pass by in a morning which
is one of the finest sights that is; added to this you view
all Blackheath, the kings parke att Greenwitch, and a vast
Country on y<sup>t</sup> side, besides y<sup>e</sup> places whence I came by:
turning about I Could view at Least 20 mile. This is
Esteemed as a noted Robbing place; on this hill are
severall springs of water w<sup>ch</sup> Comes from Allum which are
very quick purges much Like Epsome and Dullage, but I
thinke farre Exceeds Either in strength and opperation.
Thence to Greenwitch 2 mile where I ferry’d over, and
observ’d one Little shipp passed by me w<sup>ch</sup> I observ’d was
farr behind me in y<sup>e</sup> morning at Gravesend and sailed along
in sight all the tyme and was gotten before me. I fferry’d
to Popler and Stepney, so to Hackney 3 mile, thence to
Tatnum 2 mile, thence to Endfield 5 miles, w<sup>ch</sup> is all in
Middlesex Ever since I fferryed over out of Kent. Thence
to Amwellbery 10 mile in Hartfordshire w<sup>ch</sup> I Compleated
in 5 days, and went 184 miles, w<sup>ch</sup> added to severall
journeys I went in Hartfordshire and twice to Amwell and
to London againe w<sup>ch</sup> is 76 mile done, and y<sup>e</sup> severall
journeys at London and in Hartfordshire, Comes to 150
more miles besides the Little Rideings to take y<sup>e</sup> aire at
the parke or Else, w<sup>ch</sup> were severall miles more if added
together w<sup>ch</sup> I have gone this year: but w<sup>th</sup>out that it
is 226 miles, so add these to my Northern journey this
yeare makes about 1045 miles of which I did not go above
a hundred in the Coach.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span> I being in Kent this year shall Insert something of Tunbridge.
The waters I have dranke many years w<sup>th</sup> great
advantage—they are from the Steele and Iron mines, very
quick springs Especially one well. There are two w<sup>th</sup> Large
basons of stone fixt in y<sup>e</sup> Earth w<sup>th</sup> severall holes in the
bottom by w<sup>ch</sup> the springs bubble up and fill it so as it
alwayes runns over, notwithstanding the quantety dipp’d
up in a morning which is the usual tyme the Company
Comes, and the nearer they drink it the spring y<sup>e</sup> better,
it being a spiriteous water that is ready to Evaporate if
Carry’d any way, as has been try’d by weighing the water
by the well and Carrying them but to y<sup>e</sup> middle of the walks,
it has Lost of y<sup>e</sup> weight, and much more the End of the
whole walke: notwithstanding many has it brought to their
Lodgings a mile or two off and drink them in their beds,
nay, some have them brought to London w<sup>ch</sup> is near
40 miles. They have the bottles filled and corked in the
well under the Water and so seale down the Corks w<sup>ch</sup> they
say preserves it. They have made the wells very Comodious
by the many good buildings all about it and 2 or 3 mile
round which are Lodgings for the Company that drinke ye
waters, and they have Encreased their buildings so much
that makes them very Cheape. All people buy their own
provision at y<sup>e</sup> market w<sup>ch</sup> is just by y<sup>e</sup> wells and furnish’d
w<sup>th</sup> great plenty of all sorts. Flesh, fowle and fish and in
great plenty is brought from Rhye and Deale &amp;c, this being
y<sup>e</sup> road to London, so all the season the water is drank they
stop here w<sup>ch</sup> makes it very Cheape, as also the Country
people Come w<sup>th</sup> all their backyard and barne door affords
to supply them with, and their gardens and orchards, w<sup>ch</sup>
makes y<sup>e</sup> markets well stored and provision Cheape, w<sup>ch</sup> the
Gentry takes as a diversion while drinking the waters to
go and buy their dinners; it being Every day’s market and
runns the whole Length of y<sup>e</sup> walke, w<sup>ch</sup> is between high
trees on the market side for shade, and secured w<sup>th</sup> a Row of
buildings on y<sup>e</sup> Right side, w<sup>ch</sup> are shopps full of all sorts of
toys, silver China, milliners and all sorts of Curious wooden
ware w<sup>ch</sup> this place is noted for, (the delicate neate and thin
ware of wood both white and Lignum vitæ wood): besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>w<sup>ch</sup> there are two Large Coffee houses for tea, Chocolate
&amp;c, and two Roomes for y<sup>e</sup> Lottery and hazard board.
These are all built w<sup>th</sup> an arch or pent house beyond y<sup>e</sup>
shops, some of w<sup>ch</sup> are supported by pillars like a peason,
w<sup>ch</sup> is paved w<sup>th</sup> brick and stone for y<sup>e</sup> drye walking of ye
Company in raine; Else they walke w<sup>th</sup> out w<sup>ch</sup> is a Clay
and sand mixt together. They have been intending to
make it gravell w<sup>ch</sup> would be much better. All those
Conveniency’s are added by y<sup>e</sup> Companyes Contributions
Every year—what has been and so what will be. There is
at y<sup>e</sup> Lower End of the walke, w<sup>ch</sup> is a broad space before
you Come to y<sup>e</sup> walls of y<sup>e</sup> wells, a Large sun-dial set upon
severall steps of stone, thence you go straight along to a
Chapple w<sup>ch</sup> has been built by ye severall Collections of ye
Company Every year; its a pretty place and Cost a great
deal of money, and Every year there is Contribution for ye
maintenance of a minister. There are severall buildings
just about ye well where are severall apothecary’s shops,
there is also a Room for ye post house. The post Comes
Every day and returns Every day all the while the season
of drinking ye waters is, from London and to it; Except
Mondayes none Comes down from London, so on Satturdayes
non goes up to London. You pay a penny Extraordinary
for being brought from tunbridge town w<sup>ch</sup> is
4 mile distance, that being a post town, you Likewise have
the Conveniency of Coaches every day from London for
8 shillings apiece dureing the whole season, and Carriers
twice a weeke.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are severall bowling greens about y<sup>e</sup> wells, one just
at it on Mount Sion and another up y<sup>e</sup> hill Called Mount
Ephraim where is also a Large Chapple where the presbiterians
have preaching: they have a minister w<sup>ch</sup> by y<sup>e</sup>
Collections of y<sup>e</sup> Company is also maintained all the winter
to preach, as is the publick Chapple at the walks. There is
severall other Bowling greens at a distance off a mile or
two, fitted for Companys Lodging there, as Rust hall and
Southbourough; they have all houses to y<sup>e</sup> greens, so the
Gentlemen Bowle, the Ladies dance or walke in y<sup>e</sup> green in
y<sup>e</sup> afternoones, and if wet dance in the houses, there being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Musick maintained by the Company to play in the morning
so long while they drink the waters, and in y<sup>e</sup> afternoon for
danceing.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are severall good taverns at the walks and all
about to supply good wine and Brewhouses for beer and
Bakers for Bread, but some of them Come from London
and spoyle the market by raiseing y<sup>e</sup> price—so the higlers
and Hucksters in a great measure. This whole Country is
full of stone and jron, the Earth is Clay and Sand. About
3 mile off there is a good seate of the Lord Lesters
Spenshurst w<sup>ch</sup> stands in a very good parke; the house is
but old—Large roomes and stone staires and windows, a
good hall and gallery full of good old pictures, and other
roomes of state; no ffurniture but old tapistry hangings.
You have a most pleasant prospect as you go to it and from
it, of valeys Cover’d with woods of great Length, and hills
beyond on the other side. About 3 or 4 miles off is a seate
of the Lord Abergauneys w<sup>ch</sup> is Lord of the manour in a
parke and fine woods all about it, the most of the Country
is woody. There is 4 or 5 miles off a place they Cast
Gunns, there being a great store of oare all over the Country:
its a great Charge and Continuall attendance. When they
have Lighted y<sup>e</sup> fire for to Cast bells or guns they must be
Cautiously blowing, and y<sup>e</sup> mettle will be apt to fall down
on the nose of y<sup>e</sup> bellows and harden; that if it be not still
Cleared off would quickly damm up the fire and put it out.
There are severall good houses all about and a pleasant
place to Ride in in y<sup>e</sup> summer and dry weather, but a sad
deep impassable Road when much Raine has fallen. As I
was Rideing about I took a view of y<sup>e</sup> Country in many
parts. There is a Little rivulet just by the wells w<sup>ch</sup> divides y<sup>e</sup>
Countys so that y<sup>e</sup> buildings are some in Kent some in Sussex.</p>

<p class='c012'>About ffaint 4 or 5 mile off is a house of Lord Abergauny
and parkes and much woods about it. Another way by
Lakington Green and Groombridge about 4 mile off is an
old house in a parck, pretty Large, Called Ashurst w<sup>ch</sup>
they say belonged to Alderman Ashurst family, but hurst
w<sup>ch</sup> signifyes grove or wood is a name all here about, as Spenshurst
Lord Lesters house 4 mile another way in a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Parke and Speldhurst another parish 2 or 3 mile off and
Goodhurst about 12 mile off the Wells. I went by Calvery
plaine and Woods gate and so to a Little Market town
Called Branklye; the way is much thro’ Lanes, being an
Enclosed Country for the most part, w<sup>ch</sup> is the Cause of
these names as is much of Sussex w<sup>ch</sup> joyns to Kent; there
are places Called Billingshurst and Medhurst and Pendhurst
&amp;c. This Goodhurst I went to stands on a great hill and
is seen severall miles, 2 mile from y<sup>e</sup> first ascent w<sup>ch</sup> is at a
Little village belonging to it, and to y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup> hill w<sup>ch</sup> is
y<sup>e</sup> middle of y<sup>e</sup> place. Its a pretty Large place—old timber
houses, but y<sup>e</sup> Extent of y<sup>e</sup> parish is neare ten miles. They
are a sort of yeomanry Gentry, about 2 or 3 or 400£ a year
and Eate and drink well and Live Comfortably and
Hospitably.</p>

<p class='c012'>The old proverb was a yeoman of Kent w<sup>th</sup> one years
rent Could buy out y<sup>e</sup> Gentlemen of Wales and knight of
Sscales and a Lord of y<sup>e</sup> North Country—his Estate was so
much better. All in these parts are the same Minerall
waters being much on Iron mines. I returned againe to
tunbridge wells the 12 mile, then I went from thence to
Sumerhill about 4 or 5 mile off, thro’ much woods and
lanes and some pleasant shades of Lofty trees. This is a
seate of y<sup>e</sup> last viscount Purbecks—stands on a hill in a
good Large parke, built of stone and Lookes in good
repaire for y<sup>e</sup> most part, and good Large Roomes and
Staircases and abundance of good sizeable Roomes Leading
one out of another in visto’s thro’ the house, something Like
our new way of building and Lofty Enough. Its Capable
of being very fine w<sup>th</sup> visto’s of walks Cut through and across
a great many, which delights the Rider or walker being so
shady w<sup>th</sup> Lofty trees. There is remains of a bowling
green w<sup>ch</sup> is an advanced piece of ground above all the rest
and discovers the Country a great Circuite round; then we
returned to the wells againe 5 mile.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then I went from y<sup>e</sup> wells to Rye 31 miles, by Ambursly
8 mile—this was good way being a drye summer, otherwise
its deep being Clay for y<sup>e</sup> most part. I passed much
through Lanes and little villages and near Rye I went thro’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>a Comon full of Bushes and ffurze and heath; its a pretty
steep hill I ascended w<sup>ch</sup> is Called beggars hill and being
Bartholomew tide here was a faire w<sup>ch</sup> was Rightly Called
beggarhill faire being the saddest faire I ever saw—ragged
tatter’d Booths and people—but the musick and danceing
Could not be omitted. This hill on the top gave the view
of y<sup>e</sup> sea and a great tract of Land on Each side. That is
Choak’d up w<sup>th</sup> sand w<sup>ch</sup> formerly was a good haven for
shipps; the sea does still Come up to Rhye town as yet
but its shallow, and y<sup>e</sup> Castle w<sup>ch</sup> stands a Little distance—a
mile—is also left of the sea at least 4 mile. This is
Winchelsea Castle but all between it and Winchelsea is
nothing but Quagmire and marshes, drained in some places
by ditches, and this is at Least 4 miles to the town. I did
go to it but first fferry’d over a Little arm of the sea w<sup>ch</sup>
still finds a Current up to some of y<sup>e</sup> Land between Rhye
and Winchelsea, then I rode round y<sup>e</sup> marshes on y<sup>e</sup> side of
a hill in narrow foote paths, and passed over a Bridge Cross
another Little arme of y<sup>e</sup> sea: near it is a gate on y<sup>e</sup> Bridge
and Enters you into the Libertys of y<sup>e</sup> town w<sup>ch</sup> stands on
a pretty high hill. From it Lookes not of any great
Circuite of ground by y<sup>e</sup> first view, being high, but in y<sup>e</sup>
middle you see it has been a fine place for there were 36
Large Squares of building, the remaines of pieces of walls
in most places you see, or else a hedge supplys that you see
y<sup>e</sup> streetes were very broad and long and divided these
squares, ye Cross streetes y<sup>e</sup> same. I rode up a middle
streete and saw y<sup>e</sup> others run aCross of Equal breadth.
Remaines of Churches and halls are to be seen but Else
grass grows now where Winchelsea was as was once said of
Troy. There are but a very few houses now, but y<sup>e</sup> Corporation
still Continues and y<sup>e</sup> major and aldermen w<sup>ch</sup> 13
makes most of y<sup>e</sup> Inhabitants. M<sup>r</sup> Majors house Look’d
neate as did y<sup>e</sup> parsonage. They Elect two Burgesses to
it in y<sup>e</sup> parliament and its y<sup>e</sup> ancientest Corporation in
England, so y<sup>t</sup> should Lord Major of London meete M<sup>r</sup>
Major of Winchelsea he must give him place: it was as
flourishing place before the sea Left it that was in England,
but now lost, as Rhye will be in a Little tyme if the sea
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>Leaves it, w<sup>ch</sup> is in a very faire way to do; and men now
apply to quite Drane the marshes for Corn and grass Rather
than Endeavour to Cleare y<sup>e</sup> Channell of the sand w<sup>ch</sup> if it
were done would be y<sup>e</sup> best harbour for shipps as formerly
was. There are great vaults in Winchelsea w<sup>ch</sup> was the
merchants Cellars, and were houses.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was some few brass and marble statues in the
Church but much demolished as was y<sup>e</sup> Church. Rhye
town is not very bigg—a little Market place—this is famous
for fish; from hence all the good turbutt, pearle and Dorea
and all sort of sea fish Comes to supply y<sup>e</sup> wells and
London, but I could get little. Y<sup>e</sup> faire took up y<sup>e</sup> ffishermen.
Indeed here I dranke Right french white wine and
Exceeding good and then returned to y<sup>e</sup> wells 38 miles.
In the Road from thence to London you go either by Fair
lane and so Come just by S<sup>r</sup> Harry Vaines house (now
Lord Barnett), w<sup>ch</sup> Lookes very finely w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Rows of trees
about it, or Else you go by Sevenoake a sad deep Clay
way after wett. You Come in sight of a great house
on a hill Called Summerly, looks like a Little town it
runs on so much ground, it was the Lord Purbeckes.</p>

<p class='c012'>You also Come in sight of Nonsuch w<sup>ch</sup> was a great
house of the Kings Built by Charles the Second. You pass
on to the Riverhead as they Call it, a fine spring of Cleare
water y<sup>t</sup> runs thence in a Little River. is at the foote
of a great hill Called Madam Scott hill so steepe as seldome
is Either Rode down or up, and few Coaches but gaines the
top of it by a Compass round it w<sup>ch</sup> is steep Enough. This
is 15 mile from the wells—thence to Ffarnburough: about 8
mile, thence to Brumley, and to London 15 more.</p>
<h3 class='c026'><i>MY GREAT JOURNEY TO NEWCASTLE<br />AND TO CORNWALL</i>,</h3>

<p class='c027'>the account of many journeys into most parts of
England, what observation and distance of one place to
another in my travels.</p>
<p class='c012'>Ffrom London to Albins in Essex 17 mile S<sup>r</sup> Robert
abdys, Whose house stands very pleasantly in a parke full
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>of deer. The house on an advanced ground appeares to
view at y<sup>e</sup> Entrance, but its old building: Large Roomes—some
Rows of trees Lead up to it. Thence I returned
home 17 mile more, from London to Bednal-green twice,
and back againe 16 mile, from London to Highgate 4 miles
to M<sup>r</sup> Thomas’s house, where is a most exact garden w<sup>th</sup> all
sorts of greens and flowers and fish ponds. There my
Nephew Ffiennes Harrison w<sup>th</sup> M<sup>r</sup> Showers went to fish w<sup>th</sup>
me. Thence we went to Hampstead, so made it 5 mile
home againe. I went from London twice and back againe
from Kensington, in all 8 mile—this I put in only to know
the number of miles y<sup>t</sup> I went in one yeare.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom London to Amwell bery w<sup>ch</sup> is in Hartfordshire 19
mile, where I staid a day or two: thence to Bishopstafford
in Essex 13 mile, thence to Dunmew 8 long miles thro’
severall Little villages; its very deep way Especially after
raine. This is a Little Market town: they are altogether
taken up about the spinning and prepareing for the Bayes.
All along between that and Colchester you pass but halfe a
mile Ere one Comes to two or 3 houses all along the road;
its from Dunmow to Colchester 22 miles and mostly Clay
deep way. Colchester is a Large town in the Compass of
Ground. Fformerly there was 16 Churches tho’ now much
of it is ruinated. A mile before you Come to the new town
one Enters a little village which still is in the Limits of y<sup>e</sup>
Citty and Majors jurisdiction; there is a pretty good house
of y<sup>e</sup> Lord Lucas.</p>

<p class='c012'>You Enter the town by a gate; there are 4 in all; there
is a Large Streete w<sup>ch</sup> runs a great Length down to the
bridge, near a mile long: about the middle of it runs
another broad streete and near its Length like stalls on
purpose to Lay their Bayes when exposed to saile. Great
quantetyes are made here and sent in Bales to London that
is 44 miles distant. Y<sup>e</sup> whole town is Employ’d in spinning
weaveing, washing drying and dressing their Bayes in w<sup>ch</sup>
they seeme very Industrious. There I saw y<sup>e</sup> Card they
use to Comb and dress the Bayes, w<sup>ch</sup> they Call y<sup>m</sup> testles,
w<sup>ch</sup> are a kind of Rush tops or something Like them w<sup>ch</sup>
they put in frames or Laths of wood. The town Looks
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Like a thriveing place by the substantiall houses and well
pitched streetes w<sup>ch</sup> are broad Enough for two Coaches to
go a breast, besides a pitch’d walke on Either side by y<sup>e</sup>
houses secured by stumps of wood, and is Convenient for 3
to walke together. Their buildings are of timber of Loame
and Lathes and much tileing: the fashion of the Country
runs much in Long Roofes and great Cantilivers and peakes.
Out of these great streetes runs many Little streetes, but
not very narrow—mostly old buildings Except a few houses
builded by some Quakers, y<sup>t</sup> are brick and of the London
mode. The town did Extend itself to the sea but now its
ruines sets it 3 mile off. Y<sup>e</sup> low Grounds all about y<sup>e</sup> town
are used for y<sup>e</sup> whitening their Bayes for w<sup>ch</sup> this town is
remarkable, and also for Exceeding good oysters, but its a
dear place and to Grattifye my Curiosity to Eate them on
y<sup>e</sup> place I paid dear. Its a town full of Dessenters, 2 meeteings
very full besides anabaptists and quakers. Formerly
the famous M<sup>r</sup> Stockton was minister there till he Dyed.
From Colchester to jpswitch is 10 mile, and thence to
Dedom 9 miles, the way pretty good Except 4 or 5 miles
they Call y<sup>e</sup> severalls, a sort of deep moore Ground and
woody. At this place I passed over a wooden bridge, pretty
Large, w<sup>th</sup> timber railes of w<sup>ch</sup> make they build their bridges
in these parts; and now I go into Suffolk w<sup>ch</sup> is not so
rich Land as y<sup>e</sup> part of Essex I passed through, w<sup>ch</sup> was
meadows and grounds w<sup>th</sup> great burdens of grass and Corn.
So I went to jpswitch 9 mile more; this is a very Clean
town and much bigger than Colchester is now. Ipswitch
has 12 Churches, their streetes of a good size well pitch’d
w<sup>th</sup> small stones; a good market Cross railed in. I was
there on Satturday w<sup>ch</sup> is their market day and saw they
sold their Butter by y<sup>e</sup> pinte 20 ounces for 6 pence and often
for 5<sup>d</sup> or 4<sup>d</sup>; they make it up in a mold just in the shape of
a pinte pot and so sell it. Their Market Cross has good
Carving, y<sup>e</sup> ffigure of justice Carv’d and Gilt. There is but
3 or 4 good houses in y<sup>e</sup> town—y<sup>e</sup> rest is much Like y<sup>e</sup>
Colchester buildings, but it seems more shatter’d, and
Indeed the town Looks a Little disregarded, and by Enquiry
found it to be thro’ pride and sloth, for tho’ the sea would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>bear a ship of 300 tun up quite to y<sup>e</sup> Key, and y<sup>e</sup> ships of
y<sup>e</sup> first Rate Can Ride w<sup>th</sup> in two mile of the town, yet they
make no advantage thereof by any sort of manufacture, w<sup>ch</sup>
they might do as well as Colchester and Norwitch, so that
y<sup>e</sup> shipps that brings their Coales goes Light away, neither
do they address themselves to victual or provide for shipps.
They have a Little dock where formerly they built ships of
2 or 3 tun, but now Little or Nothing is minded save a
Little ffishing for y<sup>e</sup> supply of y<sup>e</sup> town. There is one pretty
good house of y<sup>e</sup> Earle of Herrifords that marry’d one of M<sup>r</sup>
Norborns Daughters, that was Killed by S<sup>r</sup> Tho: Montgomery.
You Enter thro’ two Courts walled and divided
by a breast wall on w<sup>ch</sup> are Iron spikes pallasadoes: the
Middle is a broad gravell walk fenced in w<sup>th</sup> stone walls;
on Each side 3 or 4 steps up into the other Court, and so
many steps more thro’ an arch into a third Court. This
arch joyns a Low building w<sup>ch</sup> are the offices Leaded on the
top, and rail’d round, and Each End Enters into Chambers
joyning to y<sup>e</sup> house, that is built round this Last Court
from whence you Enter y<sup>e</sup> porch. The house is handsome
all brick worke and brick pillars; a good hall, parlour, and
drawing roome, and Large Closet, 2 or 3 other Roomes less,
answereing it and a Billyard Roome above w<sup>th</sup> as many
roomes of state all ffurnish’d w<sup>th</sup> good old things: a pretty
staircase, but its all Little. There are 3 gardens on the one
side w<sup>th</sup> grass and gravell walkes all kept neate, and good
fruite; on the other side is one Large garden w<sup>th</sup> a sumer
house in w<sup>ch</sup> stands a Large statue, black, of a Gigantick
form and proportion; this answeres the fine green house on
y<sup>e</sup> other side. This town has many dessenters in it. Thence
I went to Woodbridge 7 miles mostly Lanes, Enclosed
Countrys. This is a Little Market town but has a great
meeting for y<sup>e</sup> dessenters. Thence to Wickham 5 mile
more but these are all very Long miles.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Saxmunday 8 miles more: this is a pretty
bigg market town. The wayes are pretty deep, mostly
Lanes very Little Commons. I pass’d by severall Gentlemens
seates, one, M<sup>r</sup> Dormers w<sup>ch</sup> stands in a fine parke.
Y<sup>e</sup> Entrance from y<sup>e</sup> Road thro’ rows of trees Discover’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>the front and building very finely to view, being built w<sup>th</sup>
stone and Brick and many sashes: Lookes like a new
house w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> open jron barr gates between pillars of stone
the breadth of y<sup>e</sup> house. So to Bathfort 8 miles where is
the remaines of y<sup>e</sup> walls of an abby and there is still a very
fine Church all Carv’d in stone hollow work one tire above
another to y<sup>e</sup> tower that ascends not very high but finely
Carv’d: also hence I descended with Low<sup>r</sup> grounds banck’d
on Each side w<sup>th</sup> a brick wall, but Low and so a walk on it
for foote people, and severall arches here and there to
draine off the water, so that those bancks are to secure the
Road from the Marshy ffenny water that of a great Extent
on both sides is subject to. Thence I passed by some
woods and Little villages of a few scattered houses, and
Generally y<sup>e</sup> people here are able to give so bad a Direction
that passengers are at a loss what aime to take: they know
scarce 3 mile from their home, and meete them where you
will and Enquire how farre to such a place they mind not
where they are then, but tell you so farre, w<sup>ch</sup> is the distance
from their own houses to y<sup>t</sup> place. I saw at a distance as
I descended some of their hills a Large place that Look’d
nobly and stood very high Like a Large town. They told
me it was called Either Stowle or Nole I cannot tell w<sup>ch</sup>.
I Rode in sight of S<sup>t</sup> Georges Channell In the way from
Colchester and Ipswitch and so to Norwich. Sometymes
it was in view then Lost againe. To Beckle is 8 mile more
w<sup>ch</sup> in all was 36 miles from Ipswitch, but Exceeding
Long miles; they do own they are 41 measured miles.
This is a Little market town but its the third biggest
town in y<sup>e</sup> County of Suffolke—Ipswitch Berry and
this. Here was a good big meeteing place at Least
400 hearers and they have a very good minister one M<sup>r</sup>
Killinghall; he is but a young man but seemed very
serious. I was there y<sup>e</sup> Lords day. S<sup>r</sup> Robert Rich is a
great supporter of them and Contributed to y<sup>e</sup> building
the meeteing place w<sup>ch</sup> is very neate. He has a good house
at y<sup>e</sup> End of the town w<sup>th</sup> fine gardens. There are no
good buildings the town, being old timber and plaister
work Except his and one or two more. There is a pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>bigg market Cross, and a great Market kept. There is a
handsome stone built Church and a very good publick
minister whose name is Armstrong: he preaches very well
they say notwithstanding the town is a sad Jacobitish town.
This Chooses no parliam<sup>t</sup> men. At y<sup>e</sup> towns End one
passes over the river Waveny on a wooden bridg railed w<sup>th</sup>
timber and so you Enter into Norfolk: its a Low flatt
ground all here about, so that the Least raines they are
overflowed by y<sup>e</sup> River and Lye under water as they did
when I was there, so that the roade Lay under water w<sup>ch</sup>
is very unsafe for strangers to pass by reason of y<sup>e</sup> holes
and quicksands and Loose bottom. The ordinary people
both in Suffolk and Norfolk knitt much and spin, some
w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Rock and fusoe as the French does, others at their
wheeles out in the streete and Lanes as one passes. Its
from this town to Norwitch 12 miles, and its 10 to Yarmouth
where they build some small shipps, and is a harbour
for them and where they victual them. Also Harwitch
about 12 or 14 miles also, but the miles are here as long
again as about London and pretty deep way, Especially
after raines: these miles are much Longer than most miles
in Yorkshire.</p>

<p class='c012'>Norwitch opens to view a mile distance by the help of a
hill whereon is a little village. As I observe most of y<sup>e</sup>
great towns and Cittys have about them Little villages as
attendants or appendix’s to them w<sup>ch</sup> are a sort of Subburbs,
there being stragling houses for y<sup>e</sup> most part all the way
between y<sup>t</sup> and y<sup>e</sup> gates. You pass over a high bridge y<sup>t</sup>
leads on over a high Causey of a pretty Length w<sup>ch</sup> Lookes
somewhat dangerous being fenced with trenches from its
bancks (pretty deep) that’s on both sides to secure it from
the water, and these trenches runns in many places round
the Low grounds to drain them, w<sup>ch</sup> Employ’d to whiten
and Bleach their woollen stuff the manufacture of the place.
This Long Causey brings you to the Large stone bridge
over the river into w<sup>ch</sup> those trenches Empty themselves.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then you proceed to the Citty w<sup>ch</sup> is walled round full
of towers Except on the river side w<sup>ch</sup> serves for the wall.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>They seeme y<sup>e</sup> best in repaire of any walled Citty I know
tho’ in some places there are little breaches, but the Carving
and battlements and towers Lookes well. I enter’d the
west gate. There are 12 gates in all and 36 Churches,
which is to be seen in a Clear Day altogether on the Castle
walls—I told 30 myself there. They are built all of flints
well headed or Cut w<sup>ch</sup> makes them Look blackish and
shineing. The streetes are all well pitch’d w<sup>th</sup> small stones
and very Clean, and many very broad streetes: y<sup>t</sup> I Entred
in first was very broad for 2 Coaches or Carts to pass on
Either side, and in the middle was a great well house w<sup>th</sup>
a wheele to wind up the water for the good of y<sup>e</sup> publick.
A Little further is a Large pond walled up w<sup>th</sup> brick a
mans height w<sup>th</sup> an Entrance on one End. A Little
farther was a building on which they were at work,
design’d for a water house to supply y<sup>e</sup> town by pipes into
their houses w<sup>th</sup> water. At a Little distance was another
such a pond walled in as I described before. These things
fill up the middle of this spacious streete w<sup>ch</sup> is for use and
also ornament, y<sup>e</sup> spaces Each side being so broad. This
brings you into a broad space Called the Hay market w<sup>ch</sup>
is on a hill, a very steep descent all well pitch’d as before:
this Comes to another space for a market to sell hoggs in,
and opens farther into divisions of buildings that begins
severall streetes y<sup>t</sup> runs off good Lengths and are of a
tollerable size. One runs along behind w<sup>ch</sup> is all for stalls
for y<sup>e</sup> Country butchers that bring their meate for y<sup>e</sup>
supply of y<sup>e</sup> town, w<sup>ch</sup> pay such a Rent for them to y<sup>e</sup>
town. On y<sup>e</sup> other side are houses of y<sup>e</sup> town butchers, y<sup>e</sup>
Inhabitants: by it is a Large market for fish, w<sup>ch</sup> are all
at a Little distance from y<sup>e</sup> heart of y<sup>e</sup> Citty, so is not
annoy’d w<sup>th</sup> them. There is a very Large market place
and hall and Cross for fruite and little things Every day,
and also a place under pillars for y<sup>e</sup> Corn market.</p>

<p class='c012'>The building round here is Esteemed y<sup>e</sup> best and here is
the town Hall, but all their buildings are of an old form,
mostly in deep poynts and much tileing as has been
observ’d before, and they playster on Laths w<sup>ch</sup> they strike
out into squares like broad free stone on y<sup>e</sup> outside, w<sup>ch</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>makes their fronts Look pretty well; and some they build
high and Contract y<sup>e</sup> roofes resembling the London houses,
but none of brick Except some few beyond the river w<sup>ch</sup>
are built of some of y<sup>e</sup> Rich factors like y<sup>e</sup> London buildings.
There is in y<sup>e</sup> middle of y<sup>e</sup> town the Duke of Norfolks
house of Brick and stone, w<sup>th</sup> severall towers and turrets
and balls y<sup>t</sup> Looks well, w<sup>th</sup> Large gardens, but y<sup>e</sup> Inside
is all demolished only y<sup>e</sup> walls stand and a few Roomes for
offices but nothing of state or tollerable for use.</p>

<p class='c012'>On y<sup>e</sup> Castle hill you see y<sup>e</sup> whole Citty at once, being
built round it: its a vast place and takes up a Large tract
of ground, its 6 miles in Compass.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is the County hall and Goale where y<sup>e</sup> assizes are
held and y<sup>e</sup> Sessions. Nothing of y<sup>e</sup> Castle remaines but a
green space, and under it is also a Large space for y<sup>e</sup> beast
market, and 3 tymes in y<sup>e</sup> year is there a very great faire
kept to w<sup>ch</sup> resort a vaste Concourse of people, and wares—a
full trade. Y<sup>e</sup> whole Citty Lookes Like what it is, a
Rich thriveing Industrious place; Satturday is their great
market day. They have beside y<sup>e</sup> town hall a hall distinct
w<sup>ch</sup> is the scaleing hall where their stuffs are all measured,
and if they hold their breadths and Lengths they are scaled,
but if they are deffective there is a fine Layd on y<sup>e</sup>
owner and a private marke on y<sup>e</sup> stuff w<sup>ch</sup> shews its
defficiency.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was also y<sup>e</sup> mint which they Coyn’d, but since the
old money is all new Coyn’d into mill’d money, that Ceases.
Here there is a ffine large Cathedrall and very Loftly, but
nothing remarkable of monuments or else: by it is 3
hospitalls for boys girls and old people who spinn yarne, as
does all y<sup>e</sup> town besides for y<sup>e</sup> Crapes, Callimancos and
damaskes w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> whole business of the place. Indeed
they are arrived to a great perfection in worke, so fine and
thinn and glossy; their pieces are 27 yards in Length and
their price is from 30 shillings to 3 pound as they are in
ffineness. A man Can weave 13 yards a day, I saw some
weaveing; they are all Employ’d in spinning, knitting
weaveing, dying, scouring or bleaching stuffs. Their
hospitalls are well provided for; there are 32 women in one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>as many men in y<sup>e</sup> other, there is also a good free schoole.
There is a great many Cerimonyes in y<sup>e</sup> Choice and Swearing
their major: they Elect him the first day of May and
y<sup>n</sup> prepare for his being sworne on Holly Thursday. They
new washe and plaister their houses w<sup>th</sup> in and without w<sup>ch</sup>
they strike out in squares like free stone. All y<sup>e</sup> streete in
w<sup>ch</sup> this mayor Elect’s house, is very exact in beautifying
themselves and hanging up flaggs y<sup>e</sup> Coull<sup>rs</sup> of their
Companyes, and dress up pageants and there are playes and
all sorts of show that day—in Little what is done at y<sup>e</sup>
Lord major of London show. Then they have a great
feast w<sup>th</sup> fine flaggs and scenes hung out, musick and danceing.
I was in y<sup>e</sup> hall they keep their feast in and saw some
of their preparations: for that day being about a fortnight
to it. The town is a mile and a halfe from y<sup>e</sup> North to y<sup>e</sup>
South gate. Just by one of y<sup>e</sup> Churches there is a wall
made of flints that are headed very finely and Cut so
exactly square and Even to shutt in one to another that y<sup>e</sup>
whole wall is made without Cement at all they say, but it
appears to be very little if any morter; it Looks well, very
smooth shineing and black.</p>

<p class='c012'>A great many descenters are in this Citty, the Gentlewoman
that was my acquaintance there dyed 10 dayes
before I came thither so I made no great stay there but to
see about y<sup>e</sup> town.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I went to Windham a Little market town 5 miles,
mostly on a Causey y<sup>e</sup> Country being Low and moorish,
and y<sup>e</sup> Road on y<sup>e</sup> Causey was in many places full of holes
tho’ its secured by a barr at which passengers pay a penny
a horse in order to the mending y<sup>e</sup> way, for all about is not
to be Rode on Unless its a very dry summer. Thence we
went mostly through Lanes where you meete y<sup>e</sup> ordinary
people knitting 4 or 5 in a Company under the hedges. To
Attlborough, 5 mile more to a Little village, still finding the
Country full of spinners and Knitters: thence to Thetford
6 miles more, w<sup>ch</sup> was formerly a large place but now much
decay’d and the ruines only shews it dimentions. There is
a very high hill quite round stands up on one side of it and
Can scarcely be ascended so steep. Here I Lay, w<sup>ch</sup> is still
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>in Norfolk. Next day I went to Euston Hall w<sup>ch</sup> was y<sup>e</sup>
Lord arlingtons and by his only daughters marriage w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
Duke of Grafton is his sons by her. Its two mile from
thetford, it stands in a Large parke 6 miles about. Y<sup>e</sup>
house is a Roman H of brick: 4 towers w<sup>th</sup> balls on them;
the windows are Low and not sashes Else y<sup>e</sup> roomes are of
a good size and height, a good stair case full of good
pictures, a Long gallery hung w<sup>th</sup> pictures at Length, on y<sup>e</sup>
one side the Royal family from K: Henry y<sup>e</sup> 7<sup>th</sup> by y<sup>e</sup>
Scottish race, his Eldest daughter down to y<sup>e</sup> present King
William and his queen Mary. The other side are forreign
princes from y<sup>e</sup> Emperour of Moroccoe, y<sup>e</sup> Northern and
Southern princes and Emperour of Germany. There is a
square in y<sup>e</sup> middle where stands a billiard table, hung w<sup>th</sup>
outlandish pictures of Heroes; there is Count Egmint and
Horn &amp;c &amp;c, but y<sup>e</sup> End of y<sup>e</sup> Roome is y<sup>e</sup> Duke and
Dutchess of Grafton’s picture at length. Thence I enter’d
into dineing and drawing roome and bed Chambers of a
very good size and good fret work on y<sup>e</sup> Cieling: in one
of the roomes was y<sup>e</sup> Dutchess of Cleavelands picture in a
sultaness dress, the Duke of Grafton being King Charles y<sup>e</sup>
seconds base son by her. There was also another picture
of y<sup>e</sup> Royal family. K Charles y<sup>e</sup> firsts 5 Children altogether.
I have often seen 3 w<sup>ch</sup> was K: Charles y<sup>e</sup> second,
K: James and y<sup>e</sup> Princess of Orange; but here was also y<sup>e</sup>
Lady Elizabeth and y<sup>e</sup> Duke of Glocester a Little Infant on
a pillow. In another place there is the queen mothers
picture the Lady Henrietta drawn Large. There is a fine
hall and parlour below pav’d w<sup>th</sup> free stone. There are
good gardens w<sup>th</sup> fountaines and some stone statutes, a
Cannall by y<sup>e</sup> side, a Large Court at y<sup>e</sup> Entrance w<sup>th</sup> 3 Iron
barr gates w<sup>ch</sup> open to y<sup>e</sup> ffront, divided w<sup>th</sup> stone pillars
and balls. Y<sup>e</sup> Court w<sup>th</sup> out is walled round and y<sup>e</sup> wall is
Carry’d a great Length round y<sup>e</sup> back yards. Within this
is another Court w<sup>th</sup> Iron spike pallasadoes divided Every
2 or 3 yards by little stone pillars with balls. There are
severall Rows of trees runs of a great length thro’ the parke
a visto to y<sup>e</sup> front of y<sup>e</sup> house, w<sup>ch</sup> lookes nobly tho’ not
just of y<sup>e</sup> new modell’d way of building. At y<sup>e</sup> back gate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>I crossed over y<sup>e</sup> river Waveney w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> division of y<sup>e</sup>
two County’s and enter’d Suffolk and pass’d over perfect
downs, Champion Country just like Salisbery plaine; and y<sup>e</sup>
winds have a pretty power here and blows strongly in y<sup>e</sup>
winter not well to be Endured.</p>

<p class='c012'>So to S<sup>t</sup> Edmundsbery 8 mile, but as has been often
observ’d before, the miles are very long. I pass’d by two or
3 Little villages, and about 2 mile off there is y<sup>e</sup> town of
St Edm<sup>ds</sup> Bury w<sup>ch</sup> appeares standing on a great hill, y<sup>e</sup>
towers and buildings Look so Compact and well together
w<sup>th</sup> the trees and gardens thick about it y<sup>e</sup> prospect
was wonderfully pleasant. A mile off by a little village
I descended a hill which made y<sup>e</sup> prospect of y<sup>e</sup> town
still in view and much to advantage, its but two parishes.
Y<sup>e</sup> market Cross has a dyal and Lanthorn on y<sup>e</sup> top,
and there being another house pretty Close to it high
built w<sup>th</sup> such a tower and lanthorn also, w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> two
Churches towers and some other buildings pretty good,
made it appear nobly at a distance. This high house is an
apothecarys—at least 60 stepps up from y<sup>e</sup> ground and
gives a pleaseing prospect of ye whole town. Severall
streetes but no good buildings Except this, the rest are
great old houses of timber and mostly of y<sup>e</sup> old forme of y<sup>e</sup>
Country w<sup>ch</sup> are long peaked roofes of tileing. This house
is the new mode of building; 4 roomes of a floore pretty
sizeable and high, well furnish’d, a drawing roome and
Chamber full of China and a damaske bed Embroyder’d:
2 other Roomes, Camlet and Mohaire beds; a pretty deale
of plaite in his wives Chambers and parlours below, and a
large shop. He is esteem’d a very Rich man. He shewed
me a Curiosity of an Herball all written out w<sup>th</sup> Every sort
of tree and herb dryed and Cut out and pasted on the
Leaves; it was a doctor of Physicks work that left it him
a Legacy at his Death, it was a fine thing and would have
delighted me severall dayes but I was passant. There
was two streetes were broad and very Long, out of w<sup>ch</sup> ran
a Cross 5 or 6 streetes more w<sup>ch</sup> are as good as in most
Country towns—they are well pitch’d w<sup>th</sup> small stones.
There are many descenters in y<sup>e</sup> town—4 meeteing places
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Quakers and anabaptists. There is only the ruines of
y<sup>e</sup> abby walls and the fine gate at the Entrance that
remaines—stone, well Carv’d. It seemes to be a thriveing
Industrious town; 4 gates in it.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are a great deale of Gentry w<sup>ch</sup> Lives in y<sup>e</sup> town,
tho’ there are no good houses but w<sup>ch</sup> are old and rambling
ones. They are in that they Call the green, a space by y<sup>e</sup>
Churches w<sup>ch</sup> are pretty near together. They are pretty
Large but nothing Curious in them—stone buildings—no
monuments worth notice. They keep them very Clean and
neate and have a moveable scaffold to Clean the roofe and
windows and walls. Its a very dear place, so much Company
Living in the town makes provision scarce and dear:
however its a good Excuse to raise the Reckoning on
strangers.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I went to admiral Russells who is now Lord
orfford, a long 10 mile, and Loseing my way made it 12
mile; its pretty good way. I passed by a village or two,
and in a mile of Lord orffords house I Enter Cambridgeshire,
w<sup>ch</sup> stands 3 mile from New market. You Ride in
sight of New market heath where the Races are—its good
Road; here are severall good gardens well kept good
gravell and green walks w<sup>th</sup> fine greens and flowers, walled
in and all the outhouses very handsome. A Coach yard
and stables in the middle of w<sup>ch</sup> is a Large gate into y<sup>e</sup>
ground, and built over w<sup>th</sup> a high lanthorn where hangs the
Clock and bell: this stands higher than y<sup>e</sup> house like a
tower; y<sup>e</sup> house being a flatt Roofe leaded and railed
round full of Chimneys, but this tower I saw 10 mile off.
All y<sup>e</sup> out offices built round a Court very handsome. The
hall is very noble paved w<sup>th</sup> free stone, a squaire of black
marble at Each Corner of y<sup>e</sup> freestone: there are two fine
white marble tables veined w<sup>th</sup> bleu; its wanscoated w<sup>th</sup>
wall nut tree, the pannells and Rims round w<sup>th</sup> mulbery tree
y<sup>t</sup> is a Lemon Coullour, and y<sup>e</sup> moldings beyond it round
are of a sweete outlandish wood not much differing from
Cedar but of a finer Graine, the Chaires are all the same:
its hung w<sup>th</sup> pictures att full proportion of y<sup>e</sup> Royal family
all in their Coronation Robes, from Charles the first to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Majesty w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Queen also, and at the End is Prince George
and Princess Ann in their Robes of Crimson velvet and
Dukes Coronet as Duke and Dutchess of Cumberland.
The whole house is finely furnish’d w<sup>th</sup> differing Coull<sup>d</sup>
Damaske and velvets, some ffigured and others plaine, at
Least 6 or 7 in all Richly made up after a new mode. In
y<sup>e</sup> best drawing roome was a very Rich hanging gold and
silver and a Little scarlet, mostly tissue and brocade of
gold and silver and border of green damaske round it; y<sup>e</sup>
window Curtain y<sup>e</sup> same green damaske round it y<sup>e</sup>
window Curtain y<sup>e</sup> same green damaske, and doore
Curtains. There was no Looking-glass but on y<sup>e</sup> Chimney
piece and just opposite in y<sup>e</sup> place a Looking glass used to
be was 4 pannells of glass in Length and 3 in breadth set
together in y<sup>e</sup> wanscoate. Y<sup>e</sup> same was in another drawing
roome w<sup>ch</sup> was for my Lord. The dining roome had this
Looking glass on y<sup>e</sup> top peers between the three windows;
it was from y<sup>e</sup> top to y<sup>e</sup> bottom 2 pannells in breadth and 7
in Length so it shews one from top to toe. The roomes
were all well wanscoated and hung and there was y<sup>e</sup> finest
Carv’d wood in fruitages, herbages, gumms, beasts, fowles
&amp;c. very thinn and fine all in white wood w<sup>th</sup> out paint or
varnish. Y<sup>e</sup> severall sorts of things thus Carv’d were Exceeding
naturall all round. The Chimney pieces and y<sup>e</sup>
sconces stand on Each side the Chimney, and the glasses in
those Chambers where were Loose Looking-glasses, w<sup>ch</sup>
were w<sup>th</sup> fine Carv’d head and frames some of the naturall
wood others Gilt, but they were y<sup>e</sup> largest Looking-glasses
I Ever saw. There was a great flower pott Gilt Each side
the Chimney in the dineing Roome for to sett trees in. Y<sup>e</sup>
great Curiosity of this wood Carving about y<sup>e</sup> Doores
Chimneys and sconces, together w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> great Looking Glass
pannells is much talked of and is y<sup>e</sup> finest and most in
quantety and numbers thats to be seen any where. There
is very fine China and silver things and irons and jarrs and
perfume potts of silver. Y<sup>e</sup> common Roomes are all new,
Convenient and neate with Double doores lined to prevent
noises. Y<sup>e</sup> Stair Case is wanscoated, very noble, fine
Pictures, there is y<sup>e</sup> battle at la Hogue a Large sea piece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>w<sup>th</sup> an jnscription of y<sup>e</sup> admiralls valour when y<sup>e</sup> great ship
y<sup>e</sup> Gunn was burnt and mightily valued by y<sup>e</sup> ffrench
King.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence I went 8 mile to Ely w<sup>ch</sup> were as long as the
12 I Came from S<sup>t</sup> Edmondsbery, y<sup>e</sup> wayes being very
deep; its mostly Lanes and Low moorish ground on Each
Side deffended by y<sup>e</sup> ffendiks w<sup>ch</sup> are deep ditches w<sup>th</sup>
draines. Y<sup>e</sup> ffenns are full of water and mudd these also Encompass
their grounds, Each mans part 10 or a dozen acres
a piece or more, so these dieks are the fences. On Each
side they plant willows so there is 2 rows of trees runns
round y<sup>e</sup> ground w<sup>ch</sup> Looks very finely to see a flatt of
many miles so planted but it must be ill to Live there. All
this while Ely minster is in one’s view at a mile distant you
would think, but go, it is a Long 4 miles. A mile distant
from y<sup>e</sup> town is a Little Hamlet from w<sup>ch</sup> I descended from
a steep hill and so Cross a bridge over water w<sup>ch</sup> Enters
into y<sup>e</sup> Island of Ely, and so you pass a flatt on a Gravel
Causey w<sup>ch</sup> way y<sup>e</sup> Bishop is at y<sup>e</sup> Charge to repaire Else
there would be no passing in y<sup>e</sup> summer. This is secured
by some dikes w<sup>ch</sup> surround more grounds as y<sup>e</sup> former,
full of Rows of trees and willows round them w<sup>ch</sup> makes Ely
looke finely through those trees, and y<sup>t</sup> stands very high. In
the winter this Caussey is over flowed and they have no way
but boates to pass in. They Cut peate out of some of these
grounds. The raines now had fallen so as in some places
near y<sup>e</sup> Citty y<sup>e</sup> Caussey was Covered, and a Remarkable
deliverance I had, for my horse Earnest to drinke ran to
get more depth of water than y<sup>e</sup> Caussey had, was on y<sup>e</sup>
brinke of one of these dikes, but by a speciall providence
w<sup>ch</sup> I desire never to forget and allways to be thankfull for,
Escaped. Y<sup>e</sup> bridge was over the River Linn w<sup>ch</sup> Comes
from Norfolke and does almost Encompass the jsland of
Ely w<sup>ch</sup> is 20 mile in bigness, in w<sup>ch</sup> are severall Little
towns as Wisbech and many others. There is another
River that joyns w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Linn w<sup>ch</sup> Compasses this land into
an jsland. At this bridge is a gate, but by reason of y<sup>e</sup> great
raines y<sup>e</sup> roades were full of water, even quite to y<sup>e</sup> town
w<sup>ch</sup> you ascend a very steep hill into, but y<sup>e</sup> dirtyest place I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>ever saw, not a bitt of pitching in y<sup>e</sup> streetes, so its a perfect
quagmire y<sup>e</sup> whole Citty, only just about y<sup>e</sup> palace and
Churches the streetes are well enough for breadth, but for
want of pitching it seemes only a harbour to breed and nest
vermine in of w<sup>ch</sup> there is plenty Enough, so that tho’ my
Chamber was near 20 Stepps up I had froggs and slow worms
and snailes in my Roome, but suppose it was brought up w<sup>th</sup>
y<sup>e</sup> faggotts. But it Cannot but be jnfested w<sup>th</sup> all such
things being altogether moorish ffenny ground w<sup>ch</sup> Lyes
Low: it is true were the Least Care taken to pitch their
streetes it would make it Looke more properly an habitation
for human beings and not a Cage or nest of unclean
Creatures. It must needs be very unhealthy tho’ the
natives say much to the Contrary w<sup>ch</sup> proceeds from Custom
and use, otherwise to persons born in up and dry Countryes
it must destroy them Like Rotten sheep in Consumptions
and Rhums.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Bishop does not Care to stay long in this place not
being for his health; he is the Lord of all the jsland, has
the Command and y<sup>e</sup> jurisdiction. They have lost their
Charter and so are no Corporation but all things are
directed by the Bishop and its a shame he does not see it
better ordered and y<sup>e</sup> buildings and streetes put in a better
Condition. They are a slothful people and for little but y<sup>e</sup>
takeing Care of their Grounds and Cattle w<sup>ch</sup> is of vast
advantage. Where the yeares prove drye they gaine so
much that in Case 6 or 7 wet yeares drown them all
over, the one good yeare sufficiently Repaires their
loss.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a good palace for the Bishop built of stone, but it
was unfurnished. There are two Churches; Ely minster is
a Curious pile of Building all of stone, the outside full of
Carvings and great arches and fine pillars in the front, and
the jnside has the greatest variety and neatness in the works.
There are two Chappels most Exactly Carved in stone all
sorts of figures, Cherubims Gilt and painted in some parts. Y<sup>e</sup>
Roofe of one Chappell was one Entire stone most delicately
Carved, and hung down in great poynts all about y<sup>e</sup> Church.
The pillars are Carv’d and painted w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> history of y<sup>e</sup> bible,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Especially the new testament and description of Christs
miracles. The Lanthorn in y<sup>e</sup> quire is vastly high and
delicately painted and fine Carv’d worke all of wood, in it
the bells used to be hung, five, the dimention of y<sup>e</sup> biggest
was so much when they rung them it shooke y<sup>e</sup> quire so
and y<sup>e</sup> Carv’d worke that it was thought unsafe, therefore
they were taken down. Its 80 odd steps to the top of y<sup>e</sup>
Lanthorn and 160 steps round in Compass. There are
very good monuments and abundance of niches in the
walls where Statues have been; there is one of white
marble Laying at length and so Exactly Cut y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> hand
lookes Extreamely natural, the sinewes and veines and
every turn of y<sup>e</sup> fingers so finely done as to appear very
proper. There is another that was a Bishop made by
Queen Elizabeth whose garments and all are marble and
so finely Embroydered Carv’d and painted and gilt and a
verge all down before and Round y<sup>e</sup> neck w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> ffigures of
the apostles done in Embroydery as it were, all marble
very fine. There was 4 or 5 more good Marble Statues.
There was on one of y<sup>e</sup> Pillars y<sup>e</sup> shape of y<sup>e</sup> seameless
Coate w<sup>ch</sup> Christ wore. In another place there is a great
Red Cross very high on some of y<sup>e</sup> arches, and its very
dangerous to go or Climbe round, the pillars to it being of
a vast height and this used to be as a pennance to y<sup>e</sup>
people in y<sup>e</sup> tyme of popery. There is one Chappell for
Confession w<sup>th</sup> a Roome and Chaire of State for y<sup>e</sup> priest
to set to hear y<sup>e</sup> people on their knees Confess into his
Eare through a hole in y<sup>e</sup> wall. This Church has y<sup>e</sup> most
popish remaines in its walls of any I have seen. There
still remaines a Cross over the alter; the Candlesticks are
3 quarters of a y<sup>d</sup> high massy silver gilt very heavy. The
ffont is one Entire piece of White Marble stemm and foote,
the Cover was Carv’d wood w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> image of Ch<sup>sts</sup> being
baptised by John and the holy Dove Descending on him,
all finely Carv’d white wood w<sup>th</sup> out any paint or varnish.
They Draw up the Cover by a pully and so Let it down
again w<sup>ch</sup> shutts Close unless against raines then it swells
open as it did now and I believe in y<sup>t</sup> Citty its usually
annoy’d with wet. This Cathedrall was much frequented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>by the priests in K James the Seconds tyme and many of
their Relicts washed ffaire to be seen, and y<sup>e</sup> woman told
me the priest use to shew her where Every thing was, and
they hoped quickly to be in possession of it, and made
many promises how kind they would be to them their
retainers to the Church; but blessed be God y<sup>t</sup> put a
tymely stop to the protestants utter ruin and y<sup>e</sup> hopes of
the papists. When I was upon the tower I Could see
Cambridg and a great prospect of y<sup>e</sup> Country w<sup>ch</sup> by reason
of y<sup>e</sup> great rains just before under water, all the ffenny
ground being all on a flatt unless it be one side of the
town w<sup>ch</sup> is all the high dry grounds, into w<sup>ch</sup> they drive
up their Cattle to secure them in the wet seasons. There
is no tradeing in the town, their maine buissiness and
dependance is on draining and fencing their Grounds and
breeding and grasseing Cattle. There is a fine gate of stone
arch’d Like a Church w<sup>ch</sup> is Called the abbey, but no
remaines of y<sup>e</sup> Abby Left, only as its built into houses for
the Doctors and Clergy, within which is the palace for the
Bishop which is their temporall as well as spiritual prince or
Lord. From this Citty I passed over those higher grounds
on w<sup>ch</sup> was some good Corn but mostly is for grass for their
Cattle. You see many pretty Little towns 4 or 5 in view
together 2 or 3 miles distant. I went to Sutton, one of them,
6 miles off the Citty, this was a Little Market town; thence
to y<sup>e</sup> ffenn banks on y<sup>e</sup> top of which I Rode at Least two
miles w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> ffenns on both sides w<sup>ch</sup> now were mostly under
water, a vast tract of such grounds w<sup>ch</sup> are divided by the
Dikes w<sup>th</sup> out trees, as those I observ’d before, and these
high banks are made to draine and ffence out y<sup>e</sup> water
from y<sup>e</sup> Lower grounds, and so from one banck to another
w<sup>ch</sup> are once in many acres of Land 100, so that at length
it does bear off the water but in the winter it returns, so as
they are forced to watch and be all wayes in repaireing
those bancks; and Considering y<sup>e</sup> vast allowance yearly for
draining those fenns at least 3000<sup>£</sup>  an. I wonder they have
not perfectly runn off y<sup>e</sup> water and so Barracadoed it as not
to (?) soe it often overflows it againe as it does in many places;
but they are all a lazy sort of people and are afraid to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>too much. Here I see y<sup>t</sup> many swans nests on Little
Hillocks of Earth in the wett ground that they Look as if
swimming w<sup>th</sup> their nests, some were with their young
signetts, 3 or 4 in heape w<sup>th</sup> their damms hovering over
them for their security. This brought me to the Armitage
along 8 mile in all from Ely town, and here I Repass’d the
River Lin on a wooden Bridge and so went out of y<sup>e</sup> jsland
of Ely w<sup>ch</sup> was in Cambridgshire and Entred into Huntingdonshire.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was another bridge over a deep place of y<sup>e</sup> River
under w<sup>ch</sup> the boates and barges went, and this bridge was
in the water; one must pass thro’ water to it and so
beyond it a good way, and y<sup>e</sup> Road was so full of holes
and quicksands I durst not venture, y<sup>e</sup> water Covering
them over and a stranger there Cannot Easily Escape y<sup>e</sup>
danger, tho’ I see the Carryers went y<sup>t</sup> way to save the
Expense of y<sup>e</sup> fferry, but I Rather chose to Ride round
and fferry over in a boate 2 pence a horse to a Little town.
This river runs along by S<sup>t</sup> Ives w<sup>ch</sup> was an old monastery
and a Rich one. From this fferry its 8 mile to Huntington
town; one goes much in sight of y<sup>e</sup> River and y<sup>e</sup>
severall places built on its bancks w<sup>ch</sup> Looks well—these
are pretty long miles. From Huntington town I went to
Stillton 9 mile more, and thence I went to y<sup>e</sup> Citty of
Peterborough in Lincolnshire w<sup>ch</sup> was 5 long miles, the
wayes deep and full of Sloughs. It stands very high and
to be seen at a great distance y<sup>e</sup> towers of y<sup>e</sup> minster being
all in view—one would think it but a quarter of a mile
when you have a mile or two still to it. Y<sup>e</sup> whole Citty
Looks very well and handsomely built but mostly timber
worke: you pass over a Long stone bridg. The Streetes
are very clean and neate, well pitch’d and broad as one
shall see any where, there is a very spacious market place,
a good Cross and town Hall on the top. The Cathedrall
is a magnificent building standing in the midst on advanced
ground, all stone, y<sup>e</sup> walls very neately wrought, the front
is in 3 great arches full of Small stone pillars smoothly
turn’d and halfe paces as it were in y<sup>e</sup> 2 side arches, the
head is w<sup>th</sup> no high tower but 5 Little ones, 3 of w<sup>ch</sup> in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>middle are higher and bigger than the other; between
Each are 3 peakes Like great Canteliver windows but all
finely Carv’d in stone. Ye middle arch is the Entrance w<sup>ch</sup>
is Exceeding Lofty, as is the Roofe of y<sup>e</sup> whole, and so
well painted that it appears to be hollow Carving, this
seems to be the two remarkable things in y<sup>e</sup> whole. Its a
spacious place, but one large jsle w<sup>ch</sup> is in y<sup>e</sup> middle
Leading up to y<sup>e</sup> quire, where I observed they put y<sup>e</sup> seate
of any of their deceased dignatorys of y<sup>e</sup> Church in Black
w<sup>th</sup> an Escutcheon: here was one, so now here was y<sup>e</sup>
Statue of y<sup>e</sup> person y<sup>t</sup> was last abbott and first Bishop of
y<sup>e</sup> place; there was also y<sup>e</sup> 2 monuments of 2 queens, y<sup>t</sup> of
Catherine of Spain being Harry y<sup>e</sup> 8<sup>ths</sup> queen, and also the
statute of y<sup>e</sup> queen Mary of Scotts that was both beheaded
and buried here, and there is also y<sup>e</sup> picture of an old man
w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Inscription of y<sup>e</sup> whole matter, w<sup>ch</sup> was y<sup>e</sup> Sexton
and dugg both their graves. Here is a pallace for y<sup>e</sup>
Bishop, of stone Building very neate, and y<sup>e</sup> Doctors
houses, all in a space Called the Colledg—very neate
but nothing Curious. The river Linn washes the town
almost round; it Looks like a very jndustrious thriveing
town—spinning and knitting amongst y<sup>e</sup> ordinary
people.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went thence to Wansford and passed by M<sup>rs</sup> S<sup>t</sup> Johns
house w<sup>ch</sup> stands on a hill a mile from y<sup>e</sup> town in a fine
parke. There was no gate to Peterborough town and as I
pass’d y<sup>e</sup> Road I saw upon y<sup>e</sup> walls of y<sup>e</sup> ordinary peoples
houses and walls of their out houses, y<sup>e</sup> Cow dung plaister’d
up to drie in Cakes w<sup>ch</sup> they use for fireing, its a very
offensive fewell, but y<sup>e</sup> Country people use Little Else in
these parts. Wansford is 5 mile from Peterborough, where
I passed over the Bridge w<sup>ch</sup> Entred me into Northhamptonshire,
the town being part in that shire w<sup>ch</sup> is towards
London, y<sup>e</sup> other in Lincolnshire w<sup>ch</sup> a mile or two farther
joyns w<sup>th</sup> Rutlandshire at Stamford, w<sup>ch</sup> town stands in y<sup>e</sup>
3 Countyes, where I Lay at “y<sup>e</sup> Swan in Wansford in
England,” being a jest on a man makeing hay fell a sleep
on a heap of it, and a great storme washed y<sup>e</sup> Hay and man
into y<sup>e</sup> River and Carry’d him to y<sup>e</sup> Bridge, where he awoke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>and knew not where he was, Called to y<sup>e</sup> people in y<sup>e</sup>
grounds and told them he liv’d in a place Called Wansford
in England w<sup>ch</sup> goes for a jest on y<sup>e</sup> men of Wansford to
this Day.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I went to Durant 5 miles and passed over a very
good stone bridge. Here we are neare y<sup>e</sup> quarry’s of stone,
and all y<sup>e</sup> houses and walls are built of stone as in Glocestershire.
This River and bridge Enter’d me into Leicestershire
w<sup>ch</sup> is a very Rich Country—Red land, good Corne of
all sorts and grass, both fields and jnclosures. You see a
great way upon their hills y<sup>e</sup> bottoms full of Enclosures,
woods and different sort of manureing and Herbage,
amongst w<sup>ch</sup> are placed many little towns w<sup>ch</sup> gives great
pleasure of y<sup>e</sup> travellers to view. Y<sup>e</sup> miles are long but
hither its pretty hard good way; to Coppingham 5 mile
more w<sup>ch</sup> is a neate market town. Satturday is their market
w<sup>ch</sup> is very good affording great quantetyes of Corn, Leather
garne and Cattle; such a Concourse of people y<sup>t</sup> my Landlord
told me he used to have 100 horse set up at his jnn,
and there were many publick houses. Here you see very
Large fine sheep and very good land, but very deep bad
roads. From hence to Leister w<sup>ch</sup> they Call but 13 miles,
but y<sup>e</sup> longest 13 I ever went and y<sup>e</sup> most tiresome being
full of sloughs, y<sup>t</sup> I was near 11 hours going but 25 mile,
as they Reckon it, between Wansford and Leicester town—a
footman Could have gone much faster than I Could Ride.
Their fewell here is as I said but Cowdung or Coale w<sup>ch</sup>
they are supplyed with out of Warwickshire. Leicester
town stands on the Side of a little riseing Ground, tho’ at a
distance from y<sup>e</sup> adjacent hills it Looks Low, but its a good
prospect. It has 4 gates, y<sup>e</sup> streetes are pretty Large and
well pitch’d, there are five parishes; the Market place is a
Large space very handsome w<sup>th</sup> a good Market Cross and
town hall. Y<sup>e</sup> river Sow w<sup>ch</sup> runs into y<sup>e</sup> river Reeke and
both Empts themselves into y<sup>e</sup> Trent. Trent to y<sup>e</sup> Bow
Bridge w<sup>ch</sup> is one arch over into y<sup>e</sup> Priory, w<sup>ch</sup> King Rich<sup>d</sup>
y<sup>e</sup> third pass’d over out of y<sup>e</sup> Priory when he went to fight
in Bosworth field w<sup>th</sup> King Henry the seventh, but the stone
he struck his heele at and against, w<sup>th</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> his head was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>struck at his return when brought athwart the horse Dead,
I Could not see it, being removed, but I saw a piece of his
tombstone he Lay in, w<sup>ch</sup> was Cut out in exact form for his
body to Lye in; y<sup>t</sup> remains to be seen at y<sup>e</sup> Greyhound in
Leaster but is partly broken. There I saw a piece of y<sup>e</sup>
jury wall as its Called being in arches and was a place
where the Jews burnt their sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are two Hospitalls, one for old men y<sup>e</sup> other
women 24 in number; they are allowed 2<sup>s</sup> : 8<sup>d</sup> p<sup>r</sup> weeke,
Candle, fewell oatmeale, butter and salt. I saw the Library
w<sup>ch</sup> is pretty large, there was two Large Divinity Books the
arch-Bishop gave them lately, and the names of all their
Benefactors; there was one book all written hand by a
scribe before printing was found out, it was a fine vellum;
and there was another Book of y<sup>e</sup> New Testament in
Chineaze Language and Characteur. Y<sup>e</sup> town is old timber
building Except one or two of Brick. There is Indeed
that they Call y<sup>e</sup> Newark w<sup>ch</sup> is Encompass’d w<sup>th</sup> a wall of
a good thickness and two great gates w<sup>th</sup> towers as the
town gates are, in w<sup>ch</sup> they keep their arms and amunition.
Y<sup>e</sup> walls now are only to secure gardens that are made of
y<sup>e</sup> ruin’d places that were buildings of strength. In this
Newark w<sup>ch</sup> is a large space of ground are severall good
houses some of stone and Brick In which some Lawyers
Live ffrank; there is also a new pile of Building all of
Brick w<sup>ch</sup> is the Guild Hall where y<sup>e</sup> assizes are kept twice
in y<sup>e</sup> yeare and y<sup>e</sup> session quarterly.</p>

<p class='c012'>S<sup>t</sup> Martins Church w<sup>ch</sup> is one of y<sup>e</sup> biggest—there is none
very big and none fine—but here I saw Hyricks tomb who
was major of y<sup>e</sup> town and was married to one wife 52 years
in all, w<sup>ch</sup> tyme he buried neither man woman or Child tho’
most tymes he had 20 in his family, his age was 79 and his
widdow 97 at her death, she saw 142 of her posterity
together. They have a water-house and a water mill to
turn y<sup>e</sup> water in deep Leaden tubbs or Cisterns for their
use: there are wells in some streetes to draw water by a
hand wheele for y<sup>e</sup> Common use of the town.</p>

<p class='c012'>The major and alderman goes about in procession on
Holy Thursday which was y<sup>e</sup> day I was there. Here are a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>great many descenters in this town. This Country as I s<sup>d</sup>
was all Rich deep land, and they plough their land all w<sup>th</sup>
ploughs w<sup>th</sup> out wheeles as they do in Oxfordshire and other
deep lands. From thence I passed to Bosworth 8 miles,
and went by a Gentlemans house and thro’ a little parke
where the deer were very tame, and passed through
Bosworth and over y<sup>e</sup> ground where was y<sup>e</sup> battle between
King Richard y<sup>t</sup> Lost his Life by y<sup>e</sup> hand of y<sup>e</sup> Earle of
Richmond afterwards King Henry y<sup>e</sup> Seventh, who was
Crown’d in this Bosworth field w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Crown taken off from
King Richards head, who being dead was Ignominiously
Cast aCross a horse and Carried to Leicester and buried
there as a just judgm<sup>t</sup> of God for Killing his two nephews
and reigning in their stead.</p>

<p class='c012'>This is a great flatt full of good Enclosures. Near this
is Narsby where was y<sup>e</sup> great battle fought between King
Charles y<sup>e</sup> First and y<sup>e</sup> parliam<sup>t</sup> of England. From thence
I went to Fallmouth 7 miles more and so into Warwickshire
over a bridge. This is a little market town; thence 3 miles
more to Tamworth a neate town built of Brick and mostly
new; in sight at its approach it look’d like Litchfield but
not a quarter so big a market town, it stands halfe in
Warwickshire and halfe in Staffordshire, and so to Litchfield
over a large stone bridg that Crosses y<sup>e</sup> Tamworth river
that gives name to y<sup>e</sup> town. To Litchfield is 5 mile more all
very good way mostly Gravel; I went it in an hour. This
side Entring y<sup>e</sup> town I Came by a Large good Almshouse
w<sup>ch</sup> I saw not before. They have in this town a Custome
at Whitsontide y<sup>e</sup> Monday and Tuesday Call’d y<sup>e</sup> green
Bower feast, by which they hold their Charter. The Bailiff
and Sheriff assist at y<sup>e</sup> Cerimony of dressing up Baby’s
w<sup>th</sup> garlands of flowers and Carry it in procession through
all y<sup>e</sup> streetes, and then assemble themselves at y<sup>e</sup> Market
place and so go on in a solemn procession through the great
streete to a hill beyond y<sup>e</sup> town where is a Large Bower
made w<sup>th</sup> greens in w<sup>ch</sup> they have their feast. Many lesser
Bowers they make about for Conveniency of y<sup>e</sup> Whole
Company and for selling fruite Sweetemeetes and Gingerbread
w<sup>ch</sup> is a Chief Entertainment.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span> Thence I went to Woolsely 7 mile farther, to S<sup>r</sup> Charles
Woolsley where I staid 6 weekes it being my aunt his Lady
who Engaged my stay. His seate stands very finely by y<sup>e</sup>
river Trent; there is also a moate almost round ye house.
Y<sup>e</sup> house is old timble building, only a Large parlour and
noble stair Case w<sup>th</sup> handsome Chambers S<sup>r</sup> Charles has
new built. It is built round a Court w<sup>th</sup> a gate house w<sup>ch</sup>
Leads to y<sup>e</sup> outward Court that has a paved walke, broad
stone y<sup>e</sup> same as y<sup>e</sup> first Court is paved with.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are green spaces and a fine green banck w<sup>th</sup> box or
philteroy hedge Cut round. There are very good gardens
abundance of fruite of all sorts and y<sup>e</sup> ffinest dwarfe trees I
ever saw, so thick like a hedge and a huge Compass Every
single tree, and very full of fruite of apples, pears and
Cherries; there are fine flowers, Heber roses white and
yellow; there was a fine Sena trees y<sup>t</sup> bears a great Branch
of yellow fflowers. Y<sup>e</sup> ground Lyes all well about y<sup>e</sup> house
and a fine park by the End of it, part of w<sup>ch</sup> is on a high
hill y<sup>e</sup> side of w<sup>ch</sup> the deer sport themselves, w<sup>ch</sup> looks just
on y<sup>e</sup> house and is wonderfull pleasant: its a Large parke
6 miles round full of stately woods and replenish’d w<sup>th</sup> red
and fallow deer, one part of it is pretty full of Billberryes
w<sup>ch</sup> thrive under y<sup>e</sup> shade of y<sup>e</sup> oakes, its a black berry as
big as a large pea and are Ripe about Harvest. There
is a very ill Custome amongst them now not to be broken,
when they are Ripe. The Country Comes and makes
Boothes and a sort of faire y<sup>e</sup> outside of y<sup>e</sup> parke, and so
gather y<sup>e</sup> berries and sell y<sup>m</sup> about y<sup>e</sup> Country. The
greenes they Call Wissums and on these wissums the Deer
Brouse in y<sup>e</sup> winter and on holly of which there is great
quantetys. In Kankwood just by there is also great
quantety’s of fferne w<sup>ch</sup> tho’ it over runs their ground and
so spoiles y<sup>e</sup> grass where its much, yet y<sup>e</sup> usefullness of it
renders it necessary to be preserv’d; when it is at its
maturity w<sup>ch</sup> happens just before harvest or hay tyme, y<sup>e</sup>
whole Country are Employ’d in Cutting it up and burning
it in heapes for y<sup>e</sup> sake of y<sup>e</sup> ashes w<sup>ch</sup> they make fine and
Rowle them up in Balls and so sell them or use them all
y<sup>e</sup> year for washing and scouring, and send much up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>London, y<sup>e</sup> ashe balls being Easily sent about, without w<sup>ch</sup>
they would have no ashes in the Country for such uses; for
their fewell is altogether Coales w<sup>ch</sup> Indeed are very good
and plenty, you might have a load for 3 or 4 shillings
brought home y<sup>t</sup> would serve a poore mans familly y<sup>e</sup> winter.
Its in great pieces and so Cloven burns light so as the
poorer sort works by it and so it serves for heate and light:
its very shineing Coale all about this Country tho’ they
Complaine they have lost y<sup>e</sup> vein of the best sort w<sup>ch</sup> they
Call Channell Coale and is y<sup>e</sup> sort they have still in Wales
and Lancashire w<sup>ch</sup> burnt much Lighter and less waste, but
this I thought to be very good, no better than it. I have
in London given 40<sup>s</sup> for such a Load.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this parke is severall ponds w<sup>ch</sup> affords good ffish, as
does y<sup>e</sup> moate and y<sup>e</sup> Trent as trout, Eeles, tench, perch
&amp;c, the Largest perch I ever saw just Caught and dress’d
immediately w<sup>ch</sup> Eates in perfection. Y<sup>e</sup> hill in y<sup>e</sup> parck
Called Hartshill is so high that from y<sup>e</sup> top of it you see
near 20 miles round, and shews all y<sup>e</sup> Country w<sup>ch</sup> in this
part of Staffordshire is full of woods and jnclosures and
good land, Except y<sup>e</sup> Kanck-wood w<sup>ch</sup> is but a barren heath
ground, but good wood—its fine for Hawking in y<sup>e</sup> heath.
Its full of little Brookes and Rivulets w<sup>ch</sup> abounds with
Crawfish and they were the sweetest and Largest I have
seen any where. From hence to Stafford town is 5 mile—you
go by y<sup>e</sup> banck of y<sup>e</sup> Trent most of y<sup>e</sup> way and passing
over two Rivers on stone bridges, Called y<sup>e</sup> Sore and the
Pink w<sup>ch</sup> both Empt themselves into y<sup>e</sup> Trent and so Enter
y<sup>e</sup> town through a gate. Its an old built town, timber and
plaister pretty much, in Long peaked Rooffes of tileing; 3
gates to the town—there was another w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to the
Castle w<sup>ch</sup> now is ruinated, and only remaines on a hill the
fortification trenches y<sup>t</sup> are grown over w<sup>th</sup> green. Y<sup>e</sup>
streetes are pretty Large and well pitched; a broad space
for y<sup>e</sup> market place Wherein is a good Market house on
stone pillars w<sup>th</sup> a handsome town hall over it—some of
the houses are pretty good. This Country is much for
Entertainments, in every house you must Eate and
drinke.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span> From thence back to Woolsley againe 5 miles, from thence
to Heywood parke w<sup>ch</sup> was 2 mile where Lived a Daughter
of my aunt Woolsley—marryed M<sup>r</sup> Hedgewood—a little
neate box they Live in.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence back againe 2 miles. To the Kank wood is
pleasant Rideing, its 20 mile long belongs to y<sup>e</sup> Lord Paget,
there are 4 lodges; in it a great deale of wood and deer and
goates. I went to Ffurnes Coppice w<sup>ch</sup> is 4 mile—on it a fine
Covert of tall trees on a hill and a mile farther was a fine
wood Called Hedgford; Poole a quarter of a mile long full
of good fish; thence home 5 mile. Another day I went to
Stiles Coppice 3 mile off w<sup>ch</sup> is on a high hill and a fine
tufft of trees, it Looks but Little at a distance but is a fine
Covert for y<sup>e</sup> sheep and Cattle: I went quite round it from
whence Could see y<sup>e</sup> Country a good distance and see
into 7 Countys together, Warwickshire, Leicestershire
Glocestershire Derbyshire Staffordshire Shropshire and
Cheshire; so home againe by Ridgly a mile aboute so it
was 4 mile.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another day I went to Boudezworth the Lord Pagets
house 4 mile off, and passed by y<sup>e</sup> Coale pitts where they
were digging: they draw up the Coale in baskets with a
Little wheele or Windlass like a well—its very good.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lord Paget’s house is old Brick built, y<sup>e</sup> ffront is uniforme
and very handsome with towers, but there is no good roome
but a Long gallery thats worth seeing: its a fine parke;
just by it is a high hill on w<sup>ch</sup> is the remaines of an old
ffortification, they Call it the Castle wall, its of very great
antiquity but now grown over w<sup>th</sup> grass; from thence the
prospect of the Country is great. The parke is of Large
Extent and some of those pitts are in it—y<sup>e</sup> Channell
Coales, but y<sup>e</sup> water has over flow’d some of them and
spoyl’d their digging; thence I went home againe 4 miles—Another
day I went to Panckeridge race over y<sup>e</sup> Kankwood
7 mile, where were most of y<sup>e</sup> Gentlemen and Ladies of the
Country, severall Coaches and six horses, Indeed y<sup>e</sup> miles
are Long and y<sup>e</sup> wayes bad in the winter that obliges them
to drive more horses; these were persons of good Estates also.
There appear’d only one horse to run for y<sup>e</sup> plaite which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>was a salver; thence to Woolesley again 7 mile more. Its
a fine Country here about for Rideing one has a pleaseing
prospect Every way Especially on any advanc’d ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went to Brinsy Coppice w<sup>ch</sup> was 4 mile, thence Could
see towards Shrewsbury and y<sup>e</sup> high hill the Reekee, and in
a Cleare day Could see something of Chester, and so home
againe 4 mile more. Another day I went upon Jtching hill
1 mile w<sup>ch</sup> is a sort of Rock, but y<sup>e</sup> stone is of a Red
Coullour and looks Like a sandy stone by its Moldring, but
they tell me when its wrought in a wall and have been
season’d w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> weather it grows very hard and serviceable
in building. From thence I went a Compass round to
Heywood parke 4 mile off and y<sup>n</sup> home againe 2 miles; and
another day I went the same tour about to Heywood parke
and back w<sup>ch</sup> was 6 mile more. While I stay’d at Woolsley
I went directly to Heywood parke above what I mentioned
before and returned home w<sup>ch</sup> was in all 8 miles, and another
day I went to a poole in the Kanckwood 3 mile to ffish and
from thence to Heywood parke thro’ a very fine Coppice of
trees on a hanging brow of a hill w<sup>ch</sup> Look’d very fine, and
so home 2 mile more. I name y<sup>e</sup> number of miles I went
only to see y<sup>e</sup> whole accō of miles I travell’d this yeare.
These Coppices there are many of them w<sup>ch</sup> is a good
shelter for y<sup>e</sup> Cattle.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another journey to Darby town from Woolsley by Colton
and Blithbery 3 mile, thence to Yoxwell 3 mile over Nedwood
forest of y<sup>e</sup> King, w<sup>ch</sup> is 40 mile in Extent, all y<sup>e</sup> way
you have a fine prospect of y<sup>e</sup> Country, Enclosed good
lands, admirable Corne of all sorts, good grass: I went in
sight of Tetbery Castle w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> Kings—a great ffortification,
but all decay’d—here 4 mile more and there it was that
I pass y<sup>e</sup> river Dove on a stone Bridge Called Dovebridge
w<sup>ch</sup> Enters me into Darbyshire and thence its 8 mile more
to Darby town.</p>

<p class='c012'>Darby town Lies down in a bottom built all of brick or
for y<sup>e</sup> most part; in it are 5 Churches built of stone y<sup>e</sup>
biggest of w<sup>ch</sup> I was in, y<sup>e</sup> tower was finely Carv’d full of
niches and Pedistals where on Statues had been set, but
nothing worth notice in y<sup>e</sup> jnside except a monument w<sup>ch</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>was over y<sup>e</sup> vault of y<sup>e</sup> Duke of Devonshire, on w<sup>ch</sup> stands
2 Effigees at length all of white marble y<sup>e</sup> Earle and his
Countess of Devonshire w<sup>th</sup> an arch or Cannopy of Stone
over their heads; this is rail’d in w<sup>th</sup> Iron gates. There is
also another statue of marble painted and Gilded lying at
length w<sup>ch</sup> is also railed in. Y<sup>e</sup> River Derwent runns by
the town and turns many mills, and y<sup>e</sup> water Engine w<sup>ch</sup>
turns y<sup>e</sup> water into y<sup>e</sup> pipes that serves y<sup>e</sup> town, y<sup>e</sup> same
wheele grinds also, but they do it for a half penny a strike
w<sup>ch</sup> is the same measure as our Bushill. At this Engine
they Can grind if its never so high a flood, w<sup>ch</sup> hinders all
y<sup>e</sup> other from working at y<sup>e</sup> flood, they are quite Choaked
up, but this they Can set higher or lower just as the water
is. There are bays w<sup>ch</sup> they make w<sup>th</sup> stones to keep the
water to run to y<sup>e</sup> mill and thence it falls againe into y<sup>e</sup>
Derwent; there is also a fine stone Conduit in the Market
place, w<sup>ch</sup> is very spacious, well pitch’d a good Market Cross.
This is a dear place for strangers notwithstanding y<sup>e</sup> plentyfullness
of all provision. My Dinner Cost me 5<sup>s</sup> and 8<sup>d</sup>,
only 2 servant men w<sup>th</sup> me and I had but a shoulder of
mutton and bread and beer.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here they mak great quantetys of gloves, I did not
observe or Learn any other trade or Manufacture, they had
only shops of all sorts of things. They Carry much of
their Carriages on sledges to secure their pitching in the
streetes. Thence I went to Chartly 6 mile Lord Fferrers,
and thence Bradby Lord Chesterfields, and passed by a fine
parke of some Gentlemans in w<sup>ch</sup> was a summer house on
y<sup>e</sup> side of y<sup>e</sup> hill amongst fine tall trees w<sup>ch</sup> Look’d very
well, and on y<sup>e</sup> Right hand I turned up to y<sup>e</sup> Earle of
Chesterfields parke full of fine Rows of trees running up y<sup>e</sup>
avenue to y<sup>e</sup> house. One Enters an outward Court and
drives round a Little pond like a ditch all pav’d w<sup>th</sup> stone,
or great basin of stone, in which were two swans swimming
about in y<sup>t</sup> little Compass; y<sup>e</sup> gates are all jron barrs and
the whole front of y<sup>e</sup> house open jron pallasadoe spikes in
a Compass round Like a half moone. Answerable to y<sup>t</sup>
beyond y<sup>e</sup> stable yard is another such a demy Circle of
open pallasadoe, y<sup>t</sup> lets you out to y<sup>e</sup> prospect of y<sup>e</sup> grounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>beyond, full of regular Rows of trees. Y<sup>e</sup> house has a visto
quite thro’ by a glass bellcony door into y<sup>e</sup> gardens, and so
to y<sup>e</sup> parke beyond on y<sup>t</sup> side. Y<sup>e</sup> front have something
surpriseing in it; its all of free stone w<sup>ch</sup> is dipt in oyle that
adds a varnish to its Lustre as well as security to its
foundation. Y<sup>e</sup> Roofe is not flatt as our Modern buildings
so y<sup>e</sup> garret windows Come out on y<sup>e</sup> tileing w<sup>ch</sup> is all flatt
None of y<sup>e</sup> windows are sashes which in my opinion is y<sup>e</sup>
only thing it wants to render it a Compleate building: its
halfe a roman H. There is an ascent of 5 or 6 steps all
stone to y<sup>e</sup> gates, and so you proceed on a broad paved
walke w<sup>ch</sup> is divided by a Cross walke of y<sup>e</sup> same towards
y<sup>e</sup> upper End; thence y<sup>e</sup> ascent by as many more stone
steps into a noble hall y<sup>t</sup> has a Row of white marble pillars
at y<sup>e</sup> upper End. Y<sup>e</sup> middle a Little roome w<sup>th</sup> a marble
table in the middle w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> Balcony into y<sup>e</sup> Garden, but y<sup>ts</sup>
without Steps down into y<sup>e</sup> Garden. From these Rows of
Pillars on y<sup>e</sup> Right hand runs a passage to y<sup>e</sup> Servants
roome and all the offices, and at y<sup>e</sup> End is a Chappell w<sup>ch</sup>
was very neate. Over y<sup>e</sup> alter is a large ovall of Glass of
y<sup>e</sup> sort of Private glass used in Windows to obscure y<sup>e</sup> Sight
from without, but hinders not y<sup>e</sup> Light w<sup>th</sup> inside; this
Look’d pretty as being particular and uncomon.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was a little organ and Closets for y<sup>e</sup> Lord and
Ladies to sitt in. From y<sup>e</sup> hall on the left hand Enters
into a Large roome w<sup>th</sup> a billiard table, from thence into a
Large parlour and 2 drawing-roomes,—there was a good
dineing roome. Above, y<sup>e</sup> drawing Roome had Company
in it, y<sup>e</sup> Earle having just marry’d his Eldest daughter Lady
Mary to one M<sup>r</sup> Cooke a Gentleman of a good Estate hard
by, so there was Company to wishe her joy; but I was in
severall bed Chambers, one had a Crimson damaske bed, y<sup>e</sup>
other Crimson velvet set upon halfe paces: this best was y<sup>e</sup>
bride Chamber w<sup>ch</sup> used to be Call’d y<sup>e</sup> Silver roome where
y<sup>e</sup> stands, table, and fire utensills were all massy silver, but
when plaite was in nomination to pay a tax, y<sup>e</sup> Earle of
Chesterfield sold it all and y<sup>e</sup> plaite of y<sup>e</sup> house, so that when
y<sup>e</sup> table was spread I saw only spoones, salts and forks and y<sup>e</sup>
side board plaite, noe plaites or dishes and but few salvers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Ye pictures was all burnt by a fire and so there are only
bare walls. One Roome was painted over head—y<sup>e</sup> others
frettwork, but y<sup>t</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> is most admired, and justly so to be by
all persons, and Excite their Curiosity to Come and see is
y<sup>e</sup> gardens and waterworks. Out of y<sup>e</sup> Billiard Roome y<sup>e</sup>
first was with Gravell walks, and a large fountaine in the
middle with flower potts and Greens set Round y<sup>e</sup> Brimm
of y<sup>e</sup> fountaines that are paved w<sup>th</sup> stone. You see but one
garden at a tyme. The Pipes in y<sup>e</sup> fountaines play very
finely, some of a great height, some fflushes y<sup>e</sup> water about;
then you Come to a descent of severall steps w<sup>ch</sup> discovers
anoth<sup>r</sup> fine garden w<sup>th</sup> fountaines playing through pipes
besett on y<sup>e</sup> branches w<sup>th</sup> all sort of Greens and flower
trees, dwarfe honeysuckles in a Round tuff growing upright,
and all sorts of flower trees and greens finely Cutt and
Exactly kept. In one garden there are 3 fountaines
wherein stands great statues; Each side on their pedistalls
is a dial one for y<sup>e</sup> Sun y<sup>e</sup> other a Clock w<sup>ch</sup> by y<sup>e</sup> water
worke is moved and strikes y<sup>e</sup> hours, and Chimes y<sup>e</sup> quarters,
and when they please play Lilibolaro on y<sup>e</sup> Chimes: all
this I heard when I was there. On one side of this garden
is a half Compass w<sup>th</sup> a breast wall on w<sup>ch</sup> are high jron
pallisadoes divided with severall Pillars, stone with Images
on their tops about 2 yards distance; this opens to view y<sup>e</sup>
parke and a sort of Cannall or pond w<sup>ch</sup> is in it of a good
bigness. Beyond this Garden is a Row of orange and
Lemon trees set in y<sup>e</sup> ground, of a man’s height and pretty
big, full of flowers and some Large fruit almost Ripe: this
has a pent house over it w<sup>ch</sup> is Cover’d up very Close in the
winter. This Leads on to a great wilderness and Just by it
is another Square w<sup>th</sup> a fountaine whose brim is deck’d
with flower potts full of flowers and all sorts of greens; on
Either side is 2 or 3 rows of orange and Lemon trees in
boxes one below another in growth.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just against this is a wall Cover’d over w<sup>th</sup> Lawrell finely
Cutt, and also in y<sup>e</sup> middle is an arch, and on Either side
stone staires ascends it w<sup>ch</sup> terminate in a sort of half pace
all Cover’d over w<sup>th</sup> Lawrell, and this Enters a doore into
another Garden through a little garden house. This also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>has a fine fountaine Like y<sup>e</sup> others, only as most of y<sup>e</sup> others
was green walks this was Gravell, so was the garden on y<sup>e</sup>
Right side of y<sup>e</sup> house. Ye front Garden w<sup>ch</sup> has y<sup>e</sup> Largest
fountaine has also a fine Green house and very fine flowers,
and y<sup>e</sup> beds and borders are Cut in severall formes; y<sup>e</sup>
Greens are very fine and y<sup>e</sup> hedges Cutt in severall formes;
there was one tree not much unlike y<sup>e</sup> Cyprus green but y<sup>e</sup>
branches were more spread and of a Little yellower green,
y<sup>e</sup> Barke of y<sup>e</sup> Limbs yellow—it was y<sup>e</sup> Cedar of Lebonus.
There was also fine strip’d stocks, Double Like a Rose.
There was a Large Ewe tree in y<sup>e</sup> middle of one Garden
Cut in forms, fine ffirrs and Cyprus and ffilleroy of w<sup>ch</sup> some
was striped Like silver, white, others yellow Like Gold, w<sup>ch</sup>
gave them their different names, and fine gilded and striped
Hollys.</p>

<p class='c012'>There was one green in a pott Call’d S<sup>t</sup> John y<sup>e</sup> baptists
herb, it was full of many Leaves and y<sup>e</sup> Coullour not much
unlike the green they Call Solomons Seale but longer and
bigger Leaves; its an annual plant. Here just by y<sup>e</sup>
wilderness is y<sup>e</sup> tulip tree w<sup>ch</sup> runns up of a great height
and y<sup>e</sup> flower is on y<sup>e</sup> top; it flowers in August. There is
a great avery of Birds w<sup>ch</sup> stands Like a sumer house open;
there is also many Close averys of Birds and severall Green
shady walks and Close arbours. There are very fine
woodbines grows like tuffs all in flower Red and white.
There is some of y<sup>e</sup> fountaines that have figures in them
that throws up water a greate height—a Cascade of water.</p>

<p class='c012'>Then I returned into y<sup>e</sup> hall and so into a Coole roome
in w<sup>ch</sup> was a fountaine where I dranke a Glass of wine and
so proceeded. This was 3 miles from Chartry, thence
through a fine visto or Glide of trees w<sup>ch</sup> runs along y<sup>e</sup>
parke and so to Burton on y<sup>e</sup> Trent 2 long miles. This is
a pretty large town; here is a very long stone bridge over
y<sup>e</sup> Trent: the Streetes are very well pitch’d and some very
broad.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence over Nedwood fforest 6 mile, and thence to
Yoxsell, w<sup>ch</sup> is 6 mile more to Woolsley and they are all
Long miles; then I went againe to Stafford town 5 miles
and from thence to Jnstree M<sup>r</sup> Thetwins—its bad way.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>You go by S<sup>t</sup> Thomas’s w<sup>ch</sup> was some old abbey—its still
a good house.</p>

<p class='c012'>Going along y<sup>e</sup> side of y<sup>e</sup> hill gives a great view of
y<sup>e</sup> Country that is mostly jnclosures we passed between
two parkes, y<sup>e</sup> one is Lord astons, and goe in sight of
Tixall hall w<sup>ch</sup> is a good house and Looks handsomely of
stone building: the other was M<sup>r</sup> Thetwins parke w<sup>ch</sup> has
fine Rows of trees—ffirrs Scots and Noroway and y<sup>e</sup>
picanther—the ffront lookes nobly. Noe flatt Roofed
houses in this Country but much in windows. Two Large
bow windows on Each side runns up y<sup>e</sup> whole building, y<sup>e</sup>
middle the same besides much flatt window between, so
that y<sup>e</sup> whole is Little besides window. Its built brick and
stone, the part to y<sup>e</sup> garden ward is new building of y<sup>e</sup> new
fashion and sash windows. Y<sup>e</sup> Court is 2 or 5 stepps up
w<sup>th</sup> open jron pallasadoes y<sup>e</sup> breadth of y<sup>e</sup> house and a
broad paved walk w<sup>ch</sup> Leads up to y<sup>e</sup> doore in the Middle.
Y<sup>e</sup> visto is quite through y<sup>e</sup> house to y<sup>e</sup> gardens and through
a long walke of trees of a mile through the parke to a
Lodge or summer house at y<sup>e</sup> End, w<sup>ch</sup> Lookes very finely,
it being a Riseing ground up to y<sup>e</sup> parke. There is a
Crosse paved walke in y<sup>e</sup> Court w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to a little house
on Each End like summer houses, w<sup>th</sup> towers and balls on
y<sup>e</sup> top; y<sup>e</sup> one Leads through to y<sup>e</sup> Churchyard w<sup>ch</sup> is
planted w<sup>th</sup> Rows of Ewe trees very uniforme and Cutt
neately. Y<sup>e</sup> Church is new and very handsome, good frettworke
on y<sup>e</sup> top, the wood worke well Carv’d, its seates
good wanscoate and with locks.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Chancell are two monuments of Marble, one all
white, y<sup>e</sup> other white with a border Black, and with white
pillars; the middle at y<sup>e</sup> bottom is alabaster. The pillars
of y<sup>e</sup> Church is made of y<sup>e</sup> Red stone w<sup>ch</sup> is plenty in this
Country and they are all polished over; the ffront is all
white marble; stem y<sup>e</sup> same veined bleu, y<sup>e</sup> foot is black,
y<sup>e</sup> Cover is wood Carv’d very well. The porch is very high
on w<sup>ch</sup> is a dyal, it almost breakes ones neck to Looke up
at it for y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> tower in w<sup>ch</sup> are 5 bells. There is just
against this a garden.</p>

<p class='c012'>On y<sup>e</sup> other side the dwelling house w<sup>ch</sup> is severall steps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>up it—Gravell walkes full of flowers and greens and a box
hedge Cut finely with Little trees, some Cut round, and
another hedge of strip’d holly Cut Even and some of
Lawrell Cut Even Likewise. Out of this you go into a
flower garden divided into knotts, in which were 14 Cyprus
trees w<sup>ch</sup> were grown up very tall some of them, and kept
Cutt Close in four squares down to y<sup>e</sup> bottom. Towards
y<sup>e</sup> top they Enclined to a point or spire. Thence into
another garden w<sup>th</sup> gravell walkes, and so into a summer
house through w<sup>ch</sup> you Enter a good Bowling green, w<sup>ch</sup>
also goes out of another garden, w<sup>ch</sup> takes in y<sup>e</sup> whole
breadth of y<sup>e</sup> house and is full of flowers and greens and
dwarfe trees and little borders of Severall sorts of greens
Cut Even and Close, of tyme, severall sorts and of savin
w<sup>ch</sup> is another Coullour, and of Lavender Cotten another
Coullour, and Rosemary and severall others. From this
Bowling green in y<sup>e</sup> Middle you descend 18 stepps in a
Demi Circle inwards halfe way, then y<sup>e</sup> stones are set
round and so y<sup>e</sup> half pace is, and y<sup>e</sup> other stepps are Round
turned outward, and y<sup>e</sup> Lowest much y<sup>e</sup> Largest as was y<sup>e</sup>
uppermost of y<sup>e</sup> first. This leads to a place designed for
ponds to keep ffish in but this place will not admitt of any
water works altho’ its a deep Dirty Country. They neither
have good gravell or marle to make a pond secure to hold
water, nor are they near Enough y<sup>e</sup> springs, but are forced
to be supply’d w<sup>th</sup> water by pipes from y<sup>e</sup> River trent that
is a mile off, and yet the whole place seems a quage, and
when one is descended y<sup>e</sup> hill this seemes to be the only
thing wanting, for just by the Bowling-green is a very fine
wilderness with many Large walks of a great Length full of
all sorts of trees, scycamores, willows, Hazel, Chesnutts,
walnuts, set very thicke and so shorn smooth to y<sup>e</sup> top w<sup>ch</sup>
is left as a tuff or Crown—they are very Lofty in growth
w<sup>ch</sup> makes y<sup>e</sup> Length of a walke Look Nobly. There is
also a Row on y<sup>e</sup> outside of firrs round Every grove 2 yards
or 3 distant—some silver ffirrs—some Norroway—some
Scotts and pine trees: these hold their beauty round y<sup>e</sup>
groves in y<sup>e</sup> winter when y<sup>e</sup> others Cast their Leaves.
This was from Stafford 3 mile and to Woolsley was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>3 mile more through narrow stoney Lanes through great
Heywood.</p>

<p class='c012'>Att Jnstree, M<sup>r</sup> Shetwins, I saw a fine pomegranate tree
as tall as myself, the Leafe is a long slender Leafe of a
yellowish green Edged w<sup>th</sup> red and feeles pretty thicke, y<sup>e</sup>
Blossom is white and very double. There was a terrass
walke in one of y<sup>e</sup> Gardens that gave y<sup>e</sup> full prospect of
y<sup>e</sup> Country a great way about—its a deep Country—you
are going these 3 miles to Woolsley a great while. There
was at S<sup>r</sup> Charles Woolsly’s some of y<sup>e</sup> best good land and
some of y<sup>e</sup> worst, as is y<sup>e</sup> Kankwood, but here y<sup>e</sup> Roads are
pretty good and hard w<sup>ch</sup> makes it pleasant. There is much
fine fruite here S<sup>r</sup> Charles takeing great delight in his
Gardens, I must say I never saw trees so well dress’d and
pruned, y<sup>e</sup> walls so Equally Cover’d as there. There is
severall sorts of strawbery’s but y<sup>e</sup> vermillion is y<sup>e</sup> finest,
very large as any Garden strawbery and of a fine scarlet
Coullour, but its a Later sort; there was a pretty almond
tree in Bloome y<sup>e</sup> flower not unlike a Rosemary flower.
From thence I tooke my progress Northward and went
from hence to NewCastle under Line, through Stone w<sup>ch</sup> was
9 miles, and then to Trentum, and passed by a great house
of M<sup>r</sup> Leveston Gore, and went on the side of a high hill
below which the River Trent rann and turn’d its silver
streame forward and backward into s. s w<sup>ch</sup> Looked very
pleasant Circleing about y<sup>e</sup> fine meadows in their flourishing
tyme bedecked w<sup>th</sup> hay almost Ripe and flowers. 6 mile
more to NewCastle under Line where is the fine shineing
Channell Coale; so y<sup>e</sup> proverb to both y<sup>e</sup> New-Castles of
bringing Coales to y<sup>m</sup> is a needless Labour, one being
famous for this Coale thats Cloven and makes white ashes
as is this, and y<sup>e</sup> NewCastle on y<sup>e</sup> Tyne is for y<sup>e</sup> sea Coale
y<sup>t</sup> Cakes and is what is Common and famillier to every
smith in all villages. I went to this NewCastle in Staffordshire
to see the makeing of y<sup>e</sup> fine tea potts. Cups and
saucers of y<sup>e</sup> fine red Earth in imitation and as Curious as
y<sup>t</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> Comes from China, but was defeated in my design,
they Comeing to an End of their Clay they made use of for
y<sup>t</sup> sort of ware, and therefore was remov’d to some other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>place where they were not settled at their work so Could
not see it; therefore I went on to Beteby 6 miles farther
and went by a Ruinated Castle y<sup>e</sup> walls still remaining
Called Healy Castle—this was deep Clay way. This town
is halfe in Staffordshire and halfe in Cheshire, one side of y<sup>e</sup>
streete in y<sup>e</sup> one, and y<sup>e</sup> other in y<sup>e</sup> latter, so y<sup>t</sup> they often
jest on it in travelling one wheele goes in Staffordshire y<sup>e</sup>
other wheele in Cheshire.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is a great mer or standing water 2 miles Compass—great
store of good fish; it belongs to one M<sup>r</sup> Egerton:
thence I went to Nantwitch 5 long miles. Nantwitch is a
pretty large town and well built: here are y<sup>e</sup> salt springs of
w<sup>ch</sup> they make salt and many salterns w<sup>ch</sup> were a boyling y<sup>e</sup>
salt. This is a pretty Rich land; you must travell on a
Causey; I went 3 miles on a Causey through much wood.
Its from Nantwitch to Chester town 14 long miles, y<sup>e</sup> wayes
being deep: its much on Enclosures and I passed by
severall large pooles of waters, but what I wonder’d at was
y<sup>t</sup> tho’ this shire is remarkable for a greate deale of greate
Cheeses and Dairys I did not see more than 20 or 30 Cowes
in a troope feeding, but on Enquiry find y<sup>e</sup> Custome of y<sup>e</sup>
Country to joyn their milking together of a whole village
and so make their great Cheeses. West Chester town lies
in a bottom and runs a greate length and is pretty big—there
are 10 Churches.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Cathedrall is Large and Lofty, y<sup>e</sup> quire well Carv’d,
fine tapistry hangings at y<sup>e</sup> alter, a good organ: The
Bishops pallace is on the Right hand of it and the Doctors
houses, all built of Stone. There is a new hall building w<sup>ch</sup>
is for y<sup>e</sup> assize and it stands on great Stone pillars w<sup>ch</sup> is to
be y<sup>e</sup> exchange w<sup>ch</sup> will be very Convenient and handsome;
the hall is round, its built of Bricke and Stone Coynes,
there are Leads all round w<sup>th</sup> battlements and in the middle
is a tower, there are ballconies on y<sup>e</sup> Side and windows
quite round y<sup>e</sup> Cupillow that shews y<sup>e</sup> whole town round.
There is another town hall—a long Lofty place, and
another by the Side w<sup>ch</sup> is Called the Councill Roome both
for y<sup>e</sup> Major and Aldermen to meete for y<sup>e</sup> buissinesse of y<sup>e</sup>
Corporation. Y<sup>e</sup> town is walled all aboute w<sup>th</sup> battlem<sup>ts</sup> and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>a walke all round pav’d w<sup>th</sup> stone, I allmost Encompass’d
y<sup>e</sup> walls. Ye streetes are of a greate breadth, but there is
one thing takes much from their appeareing so and from
their beauty, for on each side in most places they have made
penthouses so broad set on pillars w<sup>ch</sup> persons walk under
Covert, and is made up and down steps under which are
ware houses. Tho’ a penthouse or pallasadoe be convenient
for security from y<sup>e</sup> sun or weather and were it no broader
than for two to passe one by y<sup>e</sup> other it would be well and
No dissight to y<sup>e</sup> grace of y<sup>e</sup> Streetes, but this does darken
y<sup>e</sup> streetes and hinder y<sup>e</sup> Light of y<sup>e</sup> houses in many places
to y<sup>e</sup> streete ward below, indeed in some places were it only
before y<sup>e</sup> Chiefe persons houses it would be Convenient
where its flatt and Even w<sup>th</sup> the streetes. The town is
mostly timber buildings, the trade and Concourse of people
to it is Chiefly from the jntercourse it has with Ireland—most
take this passage; and also y<sup>e</sup> jntercourse w<sup>th</sup> Wales
w<sup>ch</sup> is parted from it and England by y<sup>e</sup> river Dee w<sup>ch</sup>
washes y<sup>e</sup> Castle Walls in w<sup>ch</sup> they keep their Stores, but
nothing fine in it. The walls and towers seemes in good
repaire. At the End of y<sup>e</sup> town just by the Castle you
Crosse over a very large and Long Bridge over the River
Dee w<sup>ch</sup> has the tyde Comes up much beyond the town;
its 7 mile off y<sup>t</sup> it falls into y<sup>e</sup> sea, but its very broad below
y<sup>e</sup> town, when at high tyde is like a very broad sea: there
they have a little Dock and build shipps of 200 tunn, I saw
some on the stocks.</p>

<p class='c012'>Cross this River by this Bridge Enters Fflintshire and so
Crossed over y<sup>e</sup> marches w<sup>ch</sup> is hazardous to strangers, therefore
M<sup>r</sup> W<sup>m</sup> Allen—w<sup>ch</sup> was y<sup>e</sup> major of Chester that time
and gave me a very Civil treate being an acquaintance of
my Brother S<sup>r</sup> Edmund Harrison—so order’d his son and
another Gentleman to Ride w<sup>th</sup> me to Direct, to Harding
w<sup>ch</sup> was 5 miles. Just by that was a very fine new built
house of Brick and in y<sup>e</sup> Exact forme of y<sup>e</sup> London Architecture
w<sup>ch</sup> was this M<sup>r</sup> Majors house and good gardens.</p>

<p class='c012'>Att Harding, where was my Relation D<sup>r</sup> Percivalls wife
who was Minister of y<sup>t</sup> place: his parish was 8 miles in
Extent and 2 lordships in it, and y<sup>e</sup> ruines of two great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>Castles in it remaines—its good Rich Land here, much on
Enclosures and woods.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a tarresse walke in my Relations garden I could very
plainly see Chester and y<sup>e</sup> River Dee with all its Washes
over the Marsh ground w<sup>ch</sup> look’d very finely: here are
sands w<sup>ch</sup> makes it very difficult for strangers to passe w<sup>th</sup>
out a guide. From hence my Relation Carry’d me to Holly
Well and pass’d thro’ Flint town w<sup>ch</sup> is the shire town
5 mile from harding; its a very Ragged place many villages
in England are better, y<sup>e</sup> houses all thatched and stone
walls, but so decay’d that in many places Ready are to
tumble down. There was a town hall such a one as it
was; it was at a Session tyme w<sup>n</sup> I was there w<sup>ch</sup> shew’d it
at its Prime. There is a Castle w<sup>ch</sup> still remaines w<sup>th</sup>
its towers built of stone, its down to y<sup>e</sup> water side: from
thence to Holy well is 3 mile mostly by y<sup>e</sup> water side
w<sup>ch</sup> is Reckon’d the sea—here I went just in sight of
high Lake where were many shipps Rideing along that
harbour.</p>

<p class='c012'>S<sup>t</sup> Winfreds Well is built over w<sup>th</sup> stone on Pillars Like a
Tryumphall arch or tower on y<sup>e</sup> gates of a Church, there is
a pavem<sup>t</sup>  of stone w<sup>th</sup> in—round 3 sides of y<sup>e</sup> well w<sup>ch</sup> is joyn’d
on y<sup>e</sup> fourth side by a great arch of stone w<sup>ch</sup> Lies over y<sup>e</sup>
water y<sup>t</sup> runs of from y<sup>e</sup> well; its many springs w<sup>ch</sup> bubbles
up very fast and Lookes Cleane in a Compass w<sup>ch</sup> is 8 square
walled in w<sup>th</sup> stone. In y<sup>e</sup> bottom w<sup>ch</sup> you see as Clear as
Chrystall are 9 stones Layd in an oval on w<sup>ch</sup> are dropps of
Red Coullour some almost quite Covering the top of y<sup>e</sup>
stone, w<sup>ch</sup> is pretended to be y<sup>e</sup> blood of this holy saint whose
head was struck off here and so where her body Laid this
spring burst forth and remaines till now a very Rapid Current,
w<sup>ch</sup> runs off from this well under a barre by w<sup>ch</sup> there are
stone stepps for y<sup>e</sup> persons to descend w<sup>ch</sup> will bathe themselves
in the well, and so they walke along y<sup>e</sup> Streame to
the other End and then come out, but there is nothing to
Shelter them but are Exposed to all the Company that are
walking about y<sup>e</sup> well and to y<sup>e</sup> Little houses and part of
y<sup>e</sup> Streete w<sup>ch</sup> runs along by it but y<sup>e</sup> Religeuse are not to
mind it, it seemes the saint they do honour to in this place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>must beare them out in all things. They tell of many
lameness’s and aches and distempers w<sup>ch</sup> are Cured by it, its
a Cold water and Cleare and runs off very quick so y<sup>t</sup> it
would be a pleasant refreshm<sup>t</sup> in y<sup>e</sup> sumer to washe ones
self in it, but its shallow not up to y<sup>e</sup> Waste so its not
Easye to Dive and washe in, but I thinke I Could not
have been persuaded to have gone in unless I might have
had Curtains to have drawn about some part of it to have
shelter’d from y<sup>e</sup> Streete, for y<sup>e</sup> wett garments are no
Covering to y<sup>e</sup> body; but there I saw abundance of y<sup>e</sup>
devout papists on their Knees all round a well. Poor
people are deluded into an jgnorant blind zeale and to be
pity’d by us y<sup>t</sup> have the advantage of knowing better and
ought to be better. There is some stones of a Reddish
Coullour in y<sup>e</sup> well s<sup>d</sup> to be some of S<sup>t</sup> Winifred’s blood
also, w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup> poore people take out and bring to y<sup>e</sup> strangers
for Curiosity and Relicts, and also moss about y<sup>e</sup> bancks
full of great virtue for Every thing. But its a Certaine
gaine to y<sup>e</sup> poore people—every one gives them something
for bringing them moss and y<sup>e</sup> stones, but lest they should
in length of tyme be quite gather’d up they take Care to
replenish it dayly from some mossy hill and so stick it
along y<sup>e</sup> sides of y<sup>e</sup> well—there is good streames runs from
it and by meanes of steepe descent runs down and turns
mills. They come also to drinke of y<sup>e</sup> water w<sup>ch</sup> they
take up in y<sup>e</sup> first square w<sup>ch</sup> is walled round and where
the springs Rise and they say its of wonder full operation.
Y<sup>e</sup> taste to me was but like good spring water w<sup>ch</sup> w<sup>th</sup> wine
and sugar and Lemons might make a pleasant Draught
after walking amongst those shady trees of w<sup>ch</sup> there is a
great many and some straight and tall like a grove but not
very uniforme. From thence I went back to Harding w<sup>ch</sup>
is 8 very Long Miles. At Holly well they speake Welsh;
the inhabitants go barefoote and bare leg’d—a nasty sort
of people. Their meate is very small here, Mutton is noe
bigger than Little Lamb, what of it there is was sweete;
their wine good being Neare y<sup>e</sup> Sea side, and are well
provided with ffish—very good Salmon and Eeles and
other ffish I had at Harding. This shire is improperly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Called Fflintshire there being noe flints in all y<sup>e</sup> Country.
There are great Coale pitts of the Channell Coale thats
Cloven huge great pieces: they have great wheeles that
are turned w<sup>th</sup> horses y<sup>t</sup> draw up the water and so draine
the Mines w<sup>ch</sup> would Else be over flowed so as they Could
not dig the Coale; they have also Engines y<sup>t</sup> draw up
their Coale in sort of baskets Like hand barrows w<sup>ch</sup> they
wind up like a Bucket in a well, for their mines are dug
down through a sort of well and sometymes its pretty Low
before they Come to y<sup>e</sup> Coales; it makes y<sup>e</sup> Road unsafe
because of y<sup>e</sup> Coale pitts and also from y<sup>e</sup> Sloughs and
quicksands, all here about being mostly near y<sup>e</sup> bancks of
y<sup>e</sup> water. In this Country are quarrys of Stone, Copper
and Iron Mines and salt hills, its a hilly place, very steep
descents and great many very high hills, but I went not so
farre as Pen Ma Mower but Cross’d y<sup>e</sup> river Dee haveing
first went two mile by these Coale mines (at least 10) in a
place (?) its a thing w<sup>ch</sup> holds neer two bushell that is their
Basket they draw up w<sup>ch</sup> is bought for 6 pence. I forded
over y<sup>e</sup> Dee when y<sup>e</sup> tide was out all upon the sands at Least
a mile, w<sup>ch</sup> was as smooth as a Die being a few hours left of
y<sup>e</sup> flood. Y<sup>e</sup> sands are here soe Loose y<sup>t</sup> the tydes does
move them from one place to another at Every flood, y<sup>t</sup>
the same place one used to ffoard a month or two before is
not to be pass’d now, for as it brings the sands in heaps to
one place so it leaves others in deep holes w<sup>ch</sup> are Cover’d
w<sup>th</sup> water and Loose sand that would swallow up a horse
or Carriages; so I had two Guides to Conduct me over.
The Carriages w<sup>ch</sup> are used to it and pass Continually at y<sup>e</sup>
Ebbs of water observes y<sup>e</sup> drift of sands and so Escape y<sup>e</sup>
danger. It was at least a mile I went on y<sup>e</sup> sands before I
Came to y<sup>e</sup> middle of y<sup>e</sup> Channell w<sup>ch</sup> was pretty deep and
with such a Current or tyde w<sup>ch</sup> was falling out to sea
together w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> wind, the horses feete could scarce stand
against it, but it was but narrow just the deep part of the
Channell and so soone over. When the tyde is fully out
they frequently fford in many places w<sup>ch</sup> they marke as the
sands fall and Can go near 9 or 10 mile over y<sup>e</sup> sands from
Chester to Burton or to Flint town almost; but many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>persons that have known the ffoards well y<sup>t</sup> have Come a
year or halfe a year after, if they venture on their former
knowledge have been overwhelm’d in the Ditches made by
y<sup>e</sup> sands w<sup>ch</sup> is deep Enough to swallow up a Coach or
waggon; but they Convey their Coales from Wales and
any other things by waggon when the tyde is out to
Chester and other parts. From Burton w<sup>ch</sup> was on y<sup>e</sup>
side of England the shore, I went to y<sup>e</sup> fferry 9 miles to
the river Meresy another great River and a perfect sea for
20 mile or more. It Comes out of Lancashire from Warrington
and both this and y<sup>e</sup> Dee Empts themselves into
y<sup>e</sup> sea almost together a few Leagues from Leverpoole,
w<sup>ch</sup> poole is form’d by a poynt of land that runs almost
round the Entrance from y<sup>e</sup> sea, being narrow and
hazardous to strangers to saile in in the winter. Y<sup>e</sup> mouth
of y<sup>e</sup> river by reason of y<sup>e</sup> Sands and Rocks is a gate to y<sup>e</sup>
River; this I ferry’d over and was an hour and halfe in y<sup>e</sup>
passage, its of great breadth and at low water is so deep
and salt as y<sup>e</sup> sea almost, tho’ it does not Cast so green a
hew on y<sup>e</sup> water as ye sea, but else the waves toss and y<sup>e</sup>
Rocks grate all round it and is as dangerous as y<sup>e</sup> sea. Its
a sort of Hoy that I ferried over and my horses—y<sup>e</sup> boate
would have held 100 people.</p>

<p class='c012'>Leverpoole w<sup>ch</sup> is in Lancashire is built just on the river
Mersy mostly new built houses of brick and stone after the
London fashion; y<sup>e</sup> first original was a few fishermens houses
and now is grown to a large fine town and but a parish and
one Church, tho’ there be 24 streetes in it. There is Indeed
a little Chappell and there are a great many dessenters in
the town. Its a very Rich trading town, y<sup>e</sup> houses of Brick
and stone built high and Even that a streete quite through
Lookes very handsome—the streetes well pitched. There
are abundance of persons you see very well dress’d and of
good fashion, y<sup>e</sup> streetes are faire and Long, its London in
miniature as much as ever I saw anything. There is a very
pretty Exchange stands on 8 pillars besides the Corners
w<sup>ch</sup> are Each Arche pillars all of stone and its railed in,
over w<sup>ch</sup> is a very handsome town hall—over all is a tower
and Cupilow thats so high that from thence one has y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>whole view of y<sup>e</sup> town and the Country round—in a Clear
day you may see y<sup>e</sup> Jsle of Man w<sup>ch</sup> also was in view from
out of Wales at Harding on the high tarrass walke in my
Cos’n Percivalls garden.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Prescote 7 very long miles, but pretty good
way, mostly Lanes; there I passed by Nosel the Earle of
Darbys house w<sup>ch</sup> Looked very nobly w<sup>th</sup> many towers and
balls on them; it stands amongst tall trees and Lookes like
a pleasant grove all about it, its an old house runs a great
Compass of ground. Y<sup>e</sup> town of Prescote stands on a high
hill, a very pretty neate Market town—a Large market
place and broad streetes well pitch’d.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Wiggon, 7 long miles more mostly in Lanes
and some hollow wayes and some pretty deep stony way so
forced us upon y<sup>e</sup> high Causey, but some of y<sup>e</sup> way was
good w<sup>ch</sup> I went pretty fast and yet by reason of the
tediousness of y<sup>e</sup> miles for length I was 5 hours going that
14 mile; I could have gone 30 miles about London in y<sup>e</sup>
tyme. There was pretty much woods and Lanes through
which I passed, and pass’d by a mer or Lake of water;
there are many of these here about, but not going through
Ormskerk. I avoided going by the famous Mer Call’d
Martin mer that as y<sup>e</sup> proverb sayes has parted many a man
and his mare—indeed it being neare evening and not
getting a Guide I was a little afraid to go that way it being
very hazardous for Strangers to passe by it. Some part of
y<sup>t</sup> mer one M<sup>r</sup> Ffleetewood has been at y<sup>e</sup> Expence to
draine so as to be able to use the ground for tillage, having
by trenches and floodgates w<sup>th</sup> banks shutt out y<sup>e</sup> waters y<sup>t</sup>
still kept it a marsh and moorish ground, but it was a very
great Charge; however it shews by industry and some
Expence, if Gentlemen would set about it, Most of y<sup>e</sup> waste
ground thats now a ffenny Moor and Mostly water might
be rendered usefull and in a few yeares answere y<sup>e</sup> first
great Charge on it. Wiggons is another pretty Market
town built of stone and brick: here it is that the fine
Channell Coales are in perfection—burns as light as a
Candle—set the Coales together w<sup>th</sup> some fire and it shall
give a snap and burn up light. Of this Coale they make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Saltcellars, Stand-dishes and many boxes and things w<sup>ch</sup> are
sent about for Curiositys and sold in London and are often
offer’d in the Exchange in Company w<sup>th</sup> white or black
marble and most people deceived by them w<sup>ch</sup> have not
been in those Countrys and know it, but such persons
discover it and will Call for a Candle to trye them whether
marble or Coale: its very finely pollish’d and Lookes much
like jett or Ebany wood for w<sup>ch</sup> one might Easily take it
when in boxes &amp;c &amp;c. I bought some of them for
Curiosity sake. 2 mile off Wigon towards Warrington (w<sup>ch</sup>
was some of my way back againe but for y<sup>e</sup> Curiosity’s sake
I did,) is the Burning well w<sup>ch</sup> burns like brandy; its a little
sorry hole in one of y<sup>e</sup> grounds 100 yards from y<sup>e</sup> Road that
Comes from Warrington to Wiggon just by a hedge or
banck, its full of dirt and mud almost but the water
Continually bubbles up as if it were a pott boyling w<sup>ch</sup> is
the spring or severall springs in that place; Nevertheless I
felt y<sup>e</sup> water and it was a Cold Spring. Y<sup>e</sup> man w<sup>ch</sup> shewed
it me, w<sup>th</sup> a dish tooke out a good quantety of y<sup>e</sup> water and
threw away and then w<sup>th</sup> a piece of Rush he lighted by a
Candle y<sup>t</sup> he brought in a lanthorne, he set y<sup>e</sup> water in y<sup>e</sup>
well on fire and it burn’d blewish just like spirits and
Continued a good while, but by reason of y<sup>e</sup> great raines y<sup>t</sup>
ffell y<sup>e</sup> night before y<sup>e</sup> spring was weaker and had not
thrown off the raine water, otherwise it used to flame all
over y<sup>e</sup> well a good height, now it burnt weaker; at last the
wind blew out y<sup>e</sup> mans Candle and he severall tymes lighted
y<sup>e</sup> bitt of Rush or splinter of wood by y<sup>e</sup> flame y<sup>t</sup> burnt in
y<sup>e</sup> well. This is a little unaccountable; I apprehend its a
sort of an unctious matter in y<sup>e</sup> Earth and soe through its
veines the springs run w<sup>ch</sup> Causes it so to burn, for I observ’d
when they dug into y<sup>e</sup> banche and opened the sort of Clay
or mudd, it burnt fiercer and more from y<sup>e</sup> well. I returned
againe to Wiggon two mile and thence to Preston and
passed by S<sup>r</sup> John Bradshaws house w<sup>ch</sup> stood on y<sup>e</sup> declineing
of a hill in y<sup>e</sup> midst of a fine grove of trees. Severall
fine walkes and Rows of trees thereabout; just in the Road
on the banck where on the hedge stood was Errected a high
stone pillar Carv’d and a ball on y<sup>e</sup> top with an jnscription
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Cutt on it shewing the Cause of it, being the monument of
an officer that in a fight just there, his horse takeing y<sup>e</sup>
hedge and Ditch on some distaste he tooke at y<sup>e</sup> Gunns and
smoake, flung out his sword out of y<sup>e</sup> scabbard and flung
his Master down on y<sup>e</sup> poynt of it w<sup>ch</sup> ran him through that
he dyed and Lyes buried on y<sup>e</sup> Spott.</p>

<p class='c012'>Preston is reckon’d but 12 mile from Wiggon but they
Exceed in Length by farre those y<sup>t</sup> I thought long the day
before from Leverpoole; its true to avoid the many Mers
and marshy places it was a great Compass I tooke, and
passed down and up very steep hills, and this way was good
Gravell way; but passing by many very Large arches y<sup>t</sup>
were only single ones but as Large as two great gate wayes,
and y<sup>e</sup> water I went through y<sup>t</sup> ran und<sup>er</sup> them was so
shallow notwithstanding these were Extreme high arches, I
enquired the Meaneing and was inform’d that on great raines
those brookes would be swelled to so great a height that unless
those arches were so high, noe passing while it were so.</p>

<p class='c012'>They are but narrow bridges for foote or horse and at
such floods they are fforced in many places to boate it till
they Come to those arches on the great Bridges w<sup>ch</sup> are
across their great Rivers; this happens sometymes on
sudden great showers for a day or two in y<sup>e</sup> summer, but y<sup>e</sup>
winter is often or mostly soe that there are deep waters so
as not Easily Cross’d; but once in 3 or 4 years there is
some of those very greate floods I mentioned before, that
they are fforced to boate from bridge to bridge w<sup>ch</sup> is little
Enough then to secure them. I passed by at Least half a
doz<sup>n</sup> of these high single arches besides severall great stone
Bridges of 4 or 6 arches which are very high also over their
greatest rivers. Preston stands on a hill and is a very good
market town; Satterday is their market w<sup>ch</sup> day I was there
and saw it was provided with all sorts of things—Leather,
Corn Coales, butter, Cheese and fruite and garden things:
there is a very spacious Market place and pretty Church and
severall good houses. At y<sup>e</sup> Entrance of y<sup>e</sup> town was a very
good house w<sup>ch</sup> was a Lawyers all stone work 5 windows in
y<sup>e</sup> front and high built according to y<sup>e</sup> Eastern building
near London; the ascent to y<sup>e</sup> house was 14 or 15 stone
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>stepps Large and a handsome Court with open jron Pallasadoes
in the gate, and on Each side, the whole breadth of
y<sup>e</sup> house, w<sup>ch</sup> discover’d the gardens on Each side of the
house, neately kept flowers and greens; there was also
many steps up to y<sup>e</sup> house from y<sup>e</sup> Court—it was a Compleate
building. There was 2 or 3 more such houses in y<sup>e</sup>
town and Indeed the Generallity of y<sup>e</sup> buildings, Especially
in 2 or 3 of y<sup>e</sup> great streetes were very handsome, better
than in most Country towns and y<sup>e</sup> streetes spacious and
well pitch’d. I was about 4 houres going this twelve mile
and Could have gone 20 in the tyme in most Countrys, nay
by the people of these parts this twelve is as long and as
much tyme taken up in going it as to go from thence to
Lancaster w<sup>ch</sup> is 20 mile, and I Can Confirme this by my
own Experience for I went to Goscoyne w<sup>ch</sup> is 10 miles and
halfe way to Lancaster in two houres, where I baited, and
here it was I was first presented w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Clap bread w<sup>ch</sup> is
much talked of made all of oates. I was surpris’d when the
Cloth was Laid, they brought a great Basket such as one
uses to undress Children with and set it on the table full of
thin waffers as big as Pancakes and drye that they Easily
breake into shivers, but Coming to dinner found it to be y<sup>e</sup>
only thing I must Eate for bread. Y<sup>e</sup> taste of oate bread is
pleasant enough and where its well made is very acceptable,
but for y<sup>e</sup> most part its scarce baked and full of drye flour
on y<sup>e</sup> outside. Y<sup>e</sup> description of how its made ought to
Come in here but I Reserve it to y<sup>e</sup> place I saw it made at
the best way. As I Come to this place which was much
over downs or a Race ground I Came along by some of y<sup>e</sup>
old Picts walls, y<sup>e</sup> ruines of which here and there remaines
in many parts of y<sup>e</sup> Country. Gascoyn is a little market
town—one Church in it w<sup>ch</sup> is a mile off from y<sup>e</sup> town, and
y<sup>e</sup> parish is 8 miles long, which discourag’d me in staying
there being Satterday night and so pressed on to Lancaster.</p>

<p class='c012'>I percieve most of y<sup>e</sup> parishes are a great tract of Land
and very Large and also beneficial, for all over Lancastershire
the revenues of y<sup>e</sup> parsonages are Considerable 2 and
300<sup>£</sup> 500 and 800 a piece, y<sup>e</sup> parson at Liverpoole has 1100
a yeare, and its frequent Everywhere 3 or 400<sup>£</sup>. Thence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>to Lancaster town 10 mile more which I Easily Reached
in 2 hours and a halfe or 3 hours; I passed through
abundance of villages almost at y<sup>e</sup> End of Every mile,
mostly all along Lanes being an Enclosed Country. They
have one good thing in most parts of this principality, or
County palatine its rather Call’d, that at all Cross wayes
there are posts w<sup>th</sup> hands pointing to each road w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> names
of y<sup>e</sup> great town or market towns that it Leads to, w<sup>ch</sup> does
make up for y<sup>e</sup> Length of y<sup>e</sup> miles y<sup>t</sup> strangers may not
Loose their Road and have it to goe back againe. You
have a great divertion on this road haveing a pleasing
prospect of y<sup>e</sup> Countrys a great distance round, and see it
full of jnclosures and some woods, three miles off y<sup>e</sup> town
you see it very plaine and y<sup>e</sup> sea, Even y<sup>e</sup> main ocean; in
one place an arm of it Comes up w<sup>th</sup> in 2 mile of y<sup>e</sup> town.
Y<sup>e</sup> River Liene runs by the town and so into y<sup>e</sup> sea. Y<sup>e</sup>
situation of Lancaster town is very good, y<sup>e</sup> Church neately
built of stone, y<sup>e</sup> Castle w<sup>ch</sup> is just by, both on a very great
ascent from y<sup>e</sup> Rest of y<sup>e</sup> town and so is in open view, y<sup>e</sup>
town and River Lying Round it beneath. On y<sup>e</sup> Castle
tower walking quite round by y<sup>e</sup> battlements I saw y<sup>e</sup> whole
town and river at a view, w<sup>ch</sup> runs almost quite round and
returns againe by y<sup>e</sup> town, and saw y<sup>e</sup> sea beyond and y<sup>e</sup>
great high hills beyond y<sup>t</sup> part of y<sup>e</sup> sea, w<sup>ch</sup> are in Wales,
and also into Westmoreland to the great hills there Called
ffurness ffells or hills, being a string of vast high hills together:
also into Cumberland to y<sup>e</sup> great hill Called Black
Comb hill whence they digg their black Lead and no
where Else; but they open y<sup>e</sup> mine but once in Severall
yeares. I also saw into Yorkshire,—there is Lead, Copper,
gold and silver in some of those hills and marble and
Christall also.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lancaster town is old and much decay’d: there has been
a monastery, the walls of part of it remaine and some of y<sup>e</sup>
Carv’d stones and ffigures; there is in it a good garden and
a pond in it w<sup>th</sup> a little jsland on w<sup>ch</sup> an apple tree grows—a
Jenitin; and Strawberys all round its Rootes and y<sup>e</sup>
banks of the Little jsle. There are 2 pretty wells and a
vault that Leads a great way under ground up as farre as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>y<sup>e</sup> Castle, w<sup>ch</sup> is a good distance. In the River there are
great weres or falls of water made for Salmon ffishing, where
they hang their nets and Catch great quantety’s of ffish, w<sup>ch</sup>
is neare the bridge. The town seemes not to be much in
trade as some others, but the great store of fish makes them
Live plentifully as also the great plenty of all provisions.
The streets are some of them well pitch’d and of a good
size; when I came into the town the stones were so slippery
Crossing some Channells that my horse was quite down on
his nose, but did at length recover himself, and so I was not
thrown off or jnjured w<sup>ch</sup> I desire to bless God for, as for
the many preservations I mett with. I Cannot say the
town seemes a lazy town and there are trades of all sorts,
there is a Large meeteing house, but their minister was but
a mean preacher; there are 2 Churches in the town which
are pretty near Each other.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I went to Kendall in Westmoreland over steepe
stony hills all like Rocks, 6 miles to one Lady Middleton,
and by some Gentlemen w<sup>ch</sup> were travelling that way that
was their acquaintance, had the advantage of going through
her parke, and saved the going Round a bad stony passage.
It was very pleasant under the shade of the tall trees. It
was an old timber house, but the family being from home
we had a free passage through it on to the Road againe,
much of w<sup>ch</sup> was stony and steep—far worse than the
Peake in Darbyshire. This Lady Middleton was a papist
and I believe the Gentlemen y<sup>t</sup> was travelling were too.
Thence to Kendall ten mile more, most of y<sup>e</sup> way was in
Lanes when I was out of the stony hills, and then into
jnclosed Lands, here in 6 miles to the town you have
very Rich good Land Enclosed—Little round green hills
flourishing w<sup>th</sup> Corn and grass as green and fresh, being in
the prime season in July. There is not much woods but
only the hedge rows round the grounds w<sup>ch</sup> Looks very
fine. In these Northern Countyes they have only the
summer Graine, as barley, oates, peas, beans, and Lentils,
noe wheate or Rhye for they are so cold and Late in their
yeare they Cannot venture at that sort of tillage, so have
none but what they are supply’d out of other Countys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>adjacent. The Land seemes here in many places very
ffertile; they have much Rhye in Lancashire Yorkshire
and Stafford and Shropshire and so Herriford and Worcestershire,
w<sup>ch</sup> I found very troublesome in my journeys, for
they would not own they had any such thing in their
bread, but it so disagrees w<sup>th</sup> me as allwayes to make me
sick w<sup>ch</sup> I found by its Effects whenever I met w<sup>th</sup> any,
tho’ I did not discern it by the taste; in Suffolke and
Norfolke I also met w<sup>th</sup> it, but in these parts its altogether
y<sup>e</sup> oatbread. Kendall is a town built all of stone, one very
broad streete in which is the Market Crosse; its a goode
tradeing town mostly famed for the Cottons: Kendall
Cotton is used for blanckets and the Scotts use them for
their Plodds and there is much made here and also Linsi-woolseys,
and a great deale of Leather tann’d here, and
all sorts of Commodityes—twice a weeke is y<sup>e</sup> market
ffurnished w<sup>th</sup> all sorts of things.</p>

<p class='c012'>The River Can w<sup>ch</sup> gives name to the town is pretty
Large but full of Rocks and stones that makes shelves and
falls in the water, its stor’d w<sup>th</sup> plenty of good ffish and
there are great ffalls of water partly naturall and added to
by putting more stones in manner of Wyers, at w<sup>ch</sup> they
Catch Salmon when they Leape with speares. The Roaring
of y<sup>e</sup> water at these places sometymes does foretell wet
weather; they do observe when the water roares most in
the fall on the Northside it will be ffaire, if on the Southside
of the town it will be wet. Some of them are falls as
high as a house. The same observation is at Lancaster at
the Wires where they Catch Salmon; against Stormes or
raines it will be turbulent and Rore as may be heard into
the town. There are 3 or 4 good houses in the town, y<sup>e</sup>
rest are like good traders houses very neate and tight.
The streetes are all pitch’d w<sup>ch</sup> is Extreame Easy to be
repair’d, for the whole Country is like one Entire Rock or
pitching almost all y<sup>e</sup> Roads. At the Kings arms, one
M<sup>rs</sup> Rowlandson, she does pott up the Charr ffish the best
of any in the Country: I was Curious to have some and so
bespoke some of her, and also was as Curious to see the
great water w<sup>ch</sup> is the only place that ffish is to be found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>in, and so went from Kendall to Bondor 6 miles thro’
narrow Lanes, but the Lands in y<sup>e</sup> jnclosures are Rich.
But here Can be noe Carriages, but very narrow ones like
Little wheele-barrows that with a horse they Convey their
fewell and all things Else. They also use horses on which
they have a sort of Pannyers some Close, some open, that
they strew full of hay turff and Lime and Dung and Every
thing they would use, and the reason is plaine, from the
narrowness of the Lanes where is good Lands they will
Loose as Little as they Can, and where its hilly and stoney
no other Carriages Can pass, so they use these horse
Carriages, and abundance of horses I see all about Kendall
streetes with their Burdens. This Kendall is the biggest
town and much in y<sup>e</sup> heart of Westmoreland, but Appleby
10 mile off is the shire town where the session and assizes
are held and is 7 miles to this great Lake Wiandermer or
great standing water w<sup>ch</sup> is 10 mile long and near halfe a
mile over in some places. It has many Little hills or jsles
in it, one of a great bigness of 30 acres of ground on which
is a house, y<sup>e</sup> Gentleman that is Lord of y<sup>e</sup> Manour Lives
in it—S<sup>r</sup> Christopher Phillips; he has a great Command
of y<sup>e</sup> water and of y<sup>e</sup> villages thereabout and many Priviledges,
he makes a Major or Bailiff of y<sup>e</sup> place during life;
its but a small mean place, M<sup>r</sup> Majors was the best Entertaining
house where I was. Y<sup>e</sup> Isle did not Looke to be
so bigg at y<sup>e</sup> shore, but takeing boate I went on it and
found it as large and very good Barley and oates and grass.
The water is very Cleer and full of good ffish, but y<sup>e</sup> Charr
ffish being out of season Could not Easily be taken, so I
saw none alive but of other ffish I had a very good supper.
The season of the Charr ffish is between Michaelmas and
Christmas; at that tyme I have had of them, w<sup>ch</sup> they pott
with sweete spices. They are as big as a small trout,
Rather slenderer and y<sup>e</sup> skinn full of spotts, some Red
Like the finns of a Perch and the jnside flesh Looks as
Red as any salmon if they are in season; their taste is
very Rich and fatt tho’ not so strong or Clogging as the
Lamprys are, but its as fatt and Rich a food. This great
water seemes to flow and wane about with y<sup>e</sup> wind but it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>does not Ebb and flow Like the sea with the tyde, neither
does it run so as to be perceivable, tho’ at y<sup>e</sup> End of it a
Little Rivulet trills from it into the Sea, but it seemes to
be a standing Lake Encompass’d with vast high hills, y<sup>t</sup>
are perfect Rocks and barren ground of a vast height, from
which many Little Springs out of y<sup>e</sup> Rock does bubble up
and descend down and fall into this water. Notwithstanding
great raines y<sup>e</sup> water does not seem much Encreas’d
tho’ it must be so, then it does draine off more at the End
of the Lake. These hills w<sup>ch</sup> they Call Ffurness Ffells a
long Row Continued some miles, and some of them are
Call’d Donum ffells and soe from the places they adjoyne
to are named, but they hold the whole length of the water
w<sup>ch</sup> is 10 mile; they have fome parts of them that has
wayes that they Can by degrees in a Compass ascend
them and so they go onward. In the Countrys, they are
fferried over the Lake when they go to market. On y<sup>e</sup>
other side over those ffells there is a sort of Stones Like
Rubbish or Broken pieces of stones, w<sup>ch</sup> Lies about a
quarry, that Lies all in the bottom of y<sup>e</sup> water; where its
so shallow as at the shores it is and very Cleer you see the
bottom; between these stones are weeds w<sup>ch</sup> grows up,
that I had some taken up just Like samfyer and I have a
fancy its a sort of sampire that Indeed is gather’d in y<sup>e</sup>
Rocks by the sea and water, and this grows in the water
but it resembles it in Coullour, ffigure and the taste not
much unlike—it was somewhat waterish. There was also
fine moss growing in the bottom of y<sup>e</sup> water. Here it was
I saw y<sup>e</sup> oat Clap bread made. They mix their flour with
water, so soft as to rowle it in their hands into a ball, and
then they have a board made round and something hollow
in the middle riseing by degrees all round to the Edge a
little higher, but so little as one would take it to be only a
board warp’d, this is to Cast out the Cake thinn and so
they Clap it round and drive it to y<sup>e</sup> Edge in a Due proportion
till drove as thinn as a paper and still they Clap it
and drive it round, and then they have a plaite of jron
same size w<sup>th</sup> their Clap board, and so shove off the Cake
on it and so set it on Coales and bake it; when Enough
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>on one side they slide it off and put the other side; if their
jron plaite is smooth and they take Care their Coales or
Embers are not too hot but just to make it Looke yellow,
it will bake and be as Crisp and pleasant to Eate as any
thing you Can jmagine, but as we say of all sorts of bread
there is a vast deal of difference in what is housewifely
made and what is ill made, so this if its well mixed and
Rowled up and but a little flour on the outside which will
drye on and make it mealy is a very good sort of food.
This is the sort of bread they use in all these Countrys,
and in Scotland they breake into their milk or broth or
Else sup that up and bite off their bread between while
they spread butter on it and Eate it with their meate.
They have no other Sort of bread unless at market towns
and that is scarce to be had unless the market dayes, soe
they make their Cake and Eate it presently, for its not so
good if 2 or 3 dayes old. It made me reflect on the
description made in Scripture of this Kneeding Cakes and
bakeing them on the hearth whenever they had Company
Come to their houses, and I Cannot but thinke it was after
this manner they made their bread in y<sup>e</sup> old tymes
Especially those Eastern Countryes where their bread
might be soone dry’d and spoil’d. Their little Carts I was
speakeing of they use hereabout, the wheeles are fastned
to the axletree and so turn altogether, they hold not above
what 5 wheelbarrows would Carry at three or four tymes,
which the Girles and Boys and women does go about with
drawn by one horse to Carry any thing they want. Here
is a great deal of good grass and Summer Corn and
pastures, its Rich Land in the bottoms as one may Call
them Considering the vast hills above them on all sides,
yet they Contain a number of Lesser hills one below
another, so that tho’ at one Looke you think it but a little
Land Every body has; Yet it being so full of hills its
many acres w<sup>ch</sup> if at Length in a plain would Extend a
vast way. I was about a quarter of an hour in the boate
before I reach’d y<sup>e</sup> island w<sup>ch</sup> is in the midst of the water
so by that you may guesse at the breadth of the water in
the whole, they fferry man and horse over it; its sometymes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>perfectly Calme. Thence I Rode almost all the
waye in sight of this great water, some tymes I lost it by
reason of y<sup>e</sup> great hills interposeing and so a Continu’d up
hill and down hill and that pretty steep, even when I was
in that they Called bottoms w<sup>ch</sup> are very rich good grounds,
and so I gained by degrees from Lower to higher hills w<sup>ch</sup>
I allwayes went up and down before I Came to another
hill. At last I attained to the side of one of these hills or
ffells of Rocks, w<sup>ch</sup> I passed on the side much about the
Middle, for Looking down to the bottom it was at Least a
Mile all full of those Lesser hills and jnclosures, so Looking
upward I was as farre from the top which was all Rocks,
and something more barren tho’ there was some trees and
woods growing in y<sup>e</sup> Rocks and hanging over all down y<sup>e</sup>
Brow of some of the hills. From these great ffells there
are severall springs out of y<sup>e</sup> Rock that trickle down their
sides, and as they meete with stones and Rocks in the
way, when something obstructs their passage and so they
Come with more violence, that gives a pleaseing sound and
murmuring noise. These descend by degrees at last fall
into the Low grounds and fructifye it w<sup>ch</sup> makes y<sup>e</sup> Land
soe ffruit full in the valleys, and upon those very high ffells
or Rocky hills its (tho’) soe high yet a moorish sort of
ground whence they digg abundance of Peat w<sup>ch</sup> they use
for their fewell, being in many places a barren ground
yeilding noe wood &amp;c. I rode in sight of this Winander
water as I was ascending another of those barren ffells w<sup>ch</sup>
tho’ I at last was not halfe way up, yet was an hour going
it up and down on the other side, going only on the side of
it about y<sup>e</sup> middle of it, but it was of such a height as to
shew one a great deale of y<sup>e</sup> Country when it happens to
be between those hills, Else those interposeing hinders any
sight but of y<sup>e</sup> Clouds. I see a good way behind me
another of those waters or mers but not very bigge. These
great hills are so full of Loose stones and shelves of
Rocks y<sup>t</sup> its very unsafe to Ride them down.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is good Marble amongst those Rocks. As I
walked down at this place I was walled on both sides by
those inaccessible high rocky barren hills w<sup>ch</sup> hangs over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>ones head in some places and appears very terrible, and
from them springs many Little Currents of water from the
sides and Clefts, w<sup>ch</sup> trickle down to some Lower part where
it runs swiftly over the stones and shelves in the way, w<sup>ch</sup>
makes a pleasant Rush and murmuring noise, and Like a
snowball is Encreased by Each spring trickling down on
either side of those hills, and so descends into the bottoms
w<sup>ch</sup> are a moorish ground in w<sup>ch</sup> in many places the waters
stand, and so forme some of those Lakes as it did here. Y<sup>e</sup>
Confluence of all these little springs being gathered together
in this lake, w<sup>ch</sup> was soe deep as the Current of water y<sup>t</sup>
passed through it was scarce to be perceived till one Came
to the farther End from whence it run a good little River
and pretty quick, over w<sup>ch</sup> many bridges are Laid. Here I
Came to villages of sad little hutts made up of drye walls,
only stones piled together and y<sup>e</sup> Roofs of same slatt; there
seemed to be little or noe tunnells for their Chimneys and
have no morter or Plaister within or without. For the
most part I tooke them at first sight for a sort of houses
or Barns to fodder Cattle in, not thinking them to be
dwelling houses, they being scattering houses, here one,
there another, in some places they may be 20 or 30
together; and the Churches the same. It must needs
be very Cold dwellings, but it shews some thing of
y<sup>e</sup> Lazyness of y<sup>e</sup> people; indeed here and there there
was a house plaister’d, but there is sad Entertainment—that
sort of Clap bread and butter and Cheese and a Cup
of beer all one Can have, they are 8 mile from a market
town and their miles are tedious to go both for illness of
way and length of y<sup>e</sup> miles.</p>

<p class='c012'>They reckon it but 8 mile from the place I was at the
night before, but I was 3 or 4 hours at Least going it.
Here I found a very good smith to shoe y<sup>e</sup> horses, for these
stony hills and wayes pulls off a shoe presently, and wears
them as thinn that it was a Constant Charge to shoe my
horses every 2 or 3 dayes, but this smith did shoe them so
well and so good shoes y<sup>t</sup> they held some of the shooes 6
weekes. Y<sup>e</sup> stonyness of the wayes all here about teaches
them y<sup>e</sup> art of makeing good shooes and setting them on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>fast. Here I cross’d one of y<sup>e</sup> stone bridges y<sup>t</sup> was pretty
Large w<sup>ch</sup> Entred me into Cumberlandshire. This River
together with y<sup>e</sup> additionall springs Continually running
into it all the way from those vaste precipices Comes into a
Low place and form a broad water w<sup>ch</sup> is very Cleer and
Reaches 7 mile in Length, Uleswater its Called, such
another water as that of Wiandermer only that reaches 10
mile in Length, from Amblside to y<sup>e</sup> sea, and this is but 7
such miles Long. Its full of such sort of Stones and flatts
in the bottom as y<sup>e</sup> other, neer the brimm where its
Shallowe you see it Cleer to y<sup>e</sup> bottom; this is secured on
Each side by such formidable heights as those Rocky ffells
in same manner as the other was. I rode the whole Length
of this water by its side, sometyme a Little higher upon the
side of the hill and sometyme just by the shore, and for 3 or
4 miles I Rode through a fine fforest or Parke where was
deer skipping about and haires, w<sup>ch</sup> by meanes of a good
Greyhound I had a Little Course, but we being strangers
could not so fast pursue it in the grounds full of hillocks
and ffurse and soe she Escaped us. I observed the boundaries
of all these great waters (which are a sort of deep
Lakes or kind of standing waters) are those sort of Barren
Rocky hills w<sup>ch</sup> are so vastly high. I Call this a standing
water because its not like other great Rivers as y<sup>e</sup> Trent
Severne, Hull or Thames &amp;c. to appear to Run w<sup>th</sup> a
streame or Current, but only as it Rowles from side to side
Like waves as the wind moves it; its true at the End of
this being a Low fall of Ground it runs off in a Little
streame. There is Exceeding good ffish here and all sorts
of provision at y<sup>e</sup> market towns. Their market town was
Peroth 10 long miles. A mile or two beyond this Ullswater,—Tuesday
is the market day w<sup>ch</sup> was the Day I came thither.
Its a Long way for y<sup>e</sup> market people to goe but they and
their horses are used to it and go w<sup>th</sup> much more facility
than strangers. At y<sup>e</sup> end of this Ullswater is a fine round
hill Look’d as green and full of wood very pleasant, w<sup>th</sup>
grass and Corne very ffruitefull, and hereabout we Leave
these Desart and Barren Rocky hills, not that they are
Limitted to Westmoreland only for had I gone farther to y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>Left hand into Cumberland I should have found more such,
and they tell me farr worse for height and stony-nesse about
White haven side and Cockermouth, so y<sup>t</sup> tho’ both the
County’s have very good land and fruitfull, so they equally
partake of y<sup>e</sup> bad, tho’ Indeed Westmoreland takes it
name from its aboundings in springs which distilling itself
on Lower ground, if of a spungy soile made it marshy or
Lakes, and in many places very fruitfull in summer graine
and grasse, but y<sup>e</sup> northerly winds blow Cold so long on
them y<sup>t</sup> they never attempt sowing their Land with wheate
or Rhye. Y<sup>e</sup> stones and slatt about Peroth Look’d so Red
y<sup>t</sup> at my Entrance into the town thought its buildings
were all of brick, but after found it to be the Coullour
of the stone w<sup>ch</sup> I saw in the Quarrys Look very Red,
their slatt is the same w<sup>ch</sup> Cover their houses. Its a
pretty Large town—a good Market for Cloth that they
spinn in the Country—hempe and also woollen. Its a
great Market for all sorts of Cattle, meate Corne &amp;c
&amp;c. Here are two Rivers one Called y<sup>e</sup> Emount w<sup>ch</sup> parts
Cumberland and Westmoreland, w<sup>ch</sup> bridge I should have
passed over had I Come the direct Roade from Kendall to
Peroth, but strikeing off to Ambleside to Wiandermer I
came another End of y<sup>e</sup> town. In this River are greate
falls of waters Call’d Cataracts, by Reason of the Rock and
shelves in it w<sup>ch</sup> makes a great noise w<sup>ch</sup> is heard more
against foul weathers into the town, tho’ the bridge be halfe
a mile out of y<sup>e</sup> town. The other River is Called Louder
w<sup>ch</sup> gives name to Lord Landsdown’s house Call’d Louder
hall w<sup>ch</sup> is four mile from Peroth. I went to it through fine
woods, the front is just faceing the great roade from Kendall
and Lookes very nobly, w<sup>th</sup> severall Rows of trees w<sup>ch</sup> Leads
to Large jron gates, open barres, into the stable yard w<sup>ch</sup> is
a fine building on y<sup>e</sup> one side of y<sup>e</sup> house very uniform, and
just against it is such another Row of buildings y<sup>e</sup> other side
of y<sup>e</sup> house Like two wings w<sup>ch</sup> is the offices. Its built
Each Like a fine house jutting out at Each End and y<sup>e</sup>
middle is w<sup>th</sup> Pillars, white, and Carvings Like the Entrance
of a building. These are just Equal and alike and
Encompass the two sides of the first Court w<sup>ch</sup> Enters, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Large jron gates and jron Palasadoes in the breadth, and
then there is an ascent of 15 stone steps turned round, very
Large, and on the top Large jron gates pallisad of jron
betweene stone pillars, w<sup>ch</sup> runs the breadth of the front.
This Court is with paved walks of broad stone, one broad
one to the house, y<sup>e</sup> other of same breadth runs aCrosse to
the stables and offices, and so there is 4 Large Squares of
grass in w<sup>ch</sup> there is a large Statue of Stone in the midst of
Each, and 4 Little Cupids or Little Boys in Each Corner of
the 4 squares. Then one ascends severall more steps to
another Little Court v<sup>th</sup> open Iron Railes, and this is
divided Into severall grass plotts by paved walks of stone
to the severall doores, some of w<sup>ch</sup> are straight, others slope:
the grass plotts being seven and in Each statue the middle-most
is taller than the rest, this is just the front of y<sup>e</sup> house
where you Enter a porch w<sup>th</sup> Pillars of Lime stone, but y<sup>e</sup>
house is y<sup>e</sup> Red sort of stone of y<sup>e</sup> Country. Below staires
you Enter a space that Leads severall wayes to all the
offices, and on one side is a Large parlour w<sup>ch</sup> Lookes out
on these green plotts w<sup>th</sup> images. The staircase very well
wanscoated and Carv’d, at y<sup>e</sup> top you are Landed into a
noble hall very Lofty, the top and sides are exquisitely
painted by y<sup>e</sup> best hand in England which did the painting
at Windsor. The Top is the Gods and goddesses that are
sitting at some great feast and a great tribunal before y<sup>m</sup>;
Each Corner is the seasons of the yeare w<sup>th</sup> the variety of
weather Raines and rainbows, stormy winds, sun shine,
snow and frost with multitudes of other fancys and varietyes
in painting and Looks very natural—it Cost 500<sup>£</sup> that
roome alone. Thence into a Dineing room and drawing
roome well wanscoated of oake, Large pannells plaine, no
frettwork nor Carvings or Glass worke, only in Chimney
pieces. 3 handsome Chambers, one scarlet Cloth strip’d
and very fashionably made up, the hangings the same,
another flower’d Damaske Lined with fine jndian Embroidery,
the third Roome had a blew satten bed Embroider’d.
In this Roome was very fine orris hangings in
w<sup>ch</sup> was much silk and gold and silver; a Little Roome by
in w<sup>ch</sup> was a green and white Damaske Canopy bed w<sup>ch</sup> was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>hung w<sup>th</sup> some of the same hangings being made for y<sup>e</sup>
Duke of Lortherdale and had his armes in many places—by
his Dying were sold to Lord Landsdon.</p>

<p class='c012'>They Containe a Scottish story of the 4 quarters of the
yeare. The roomes are all well pitch’d and well ffinish’d,
and many good Pictures of y<sup>e</sup> family, and severall good
fancy’s of human and animals, a good gallery so adorn’d
w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to a Closet that Looks into y<sup>e</sup> Chappell; all
things very neate tho’ nothing Extraord<sup>y</sup> besides y<sup>e</sup> hall
painting. The Chimney pieces are of a dark Coull<sup>d</sup> Marble
w<sup>ch</sup> is taken out of the ground just by—its well polish’d.
There was some few white marble vein’d, but that is not
Dug out of this Country. The house is a flatt rooffe and
stands amidst a wood of Rows of trees, w<sup>ch</sup> w<sup>th</sup> these statues
and those in two gardens on Each side (w<sup>ch</sup> for their walks
and plantations is not ffinish’d but full of Statues) which
with the house is so well Contrived to be seen at one view.
Y<sup>e</sup> Lady Landsdown sent and treated me with a Breakfast,
Cold things and sweete meates all serv’d in plaite, but it was
so Early in the morning that she being jndisposed was not
up. So I returned back 4 mile to Peroth and Came in
sight of Severall Genteele seates or Gentlemens houses, and
Came by a Round green spott of a Large Circumfference
which they keep Cut round w<sup>th</sup> a banke round it like a
Bench; its story is that it was the table a great Giant 6
yards tall, used to Dine at, and there Entertain’d anoth<sup>r</sup> of
nine yards tall which he afterwards killed; there is the
Length in the Church yard how far he Could Leape—a
great many Yards. There was also on the Church at
Peroth a fine Clock w<sup>ch</sup> had severall motions—there was
the Starrs and signes, there was the Encrease and Changes
of y<sup>e</sup> moone, by a Darke and golden side of a Little Globe.
A mile from Peroth in a Low bottom and moorish place
stands Mag and her sisters; the story is that these soliciting
her to an unlawfull Love by an Enchantment are turned
w<sup>th</sup> her into stone; the stone in the middle w<sup>ch</sup> is Call’d Mag
is much bigger and have some fforme Like a statue or ffigure
of a body, but the Rest are but soe many Craggy stones,
but they affirme they Cannot be Counted twice alike as is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>the story of Stonidge, but the number of these are not above
30. However what the first design of placeing them there
Either as a marke of y<sup>t</sup> sort of moorish Ground or what
Else, the thing is not so wonderfull as that of Stonidge,
because there is noe such sort of stone in 20 miles off those
downs and how they of so vast a bulk and weight should
be brought thither, whereas all this Country abounds
with Quarrys of stone and its mostly Rocks. The waye
from thence to Carlisle over much heath where they have
many stone Quarrys and Cut much peate and turff w<sup>ch</sup> is
their Chief fuel. Its reckon’d but 16 mile from Peroth to
Carlisle, but they are pretty Long, besides my going out of
y<sup>e</sup> waye above 3 or 4 mile w<sup>ch</sup> made it 20. They were very
Long and I was a great while Rideing it. You pass by the
Little hutts and hovels the poor Live in Like Barnes—some
have them daub’d w<sup>th</sup> mud-wall—others drye walls.</p>

<p class='c012'>Carlisle stands in view at Least 4 mile distant, y<sup>e</sup> town is
walled in and all built of stone. The Cathedrall stands
high and very Eminent to be seen above y<sup>e</sup> town. You
Enter over the Bridge and Double gates w<sup>ch</sup> are jron grates
and Lined w<sup>th</sup> a Case of doores of thick timber, there are 3
gates to the town, one Called the English gate at which I
entred. The other the jrish w<sup>ch</sup> Leads on to Whitehaven
and Cockermouth, the other y<sup>e</sup> Scottish gate through which
I went into Scotland. The walls of the town and Battlements
and towers are in very good Repaire and Looks well.
Y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall all built of stone which Looked stately but
nothing Curious; there was some few houses as y<sup>e</sup> Deans
and treasurer and some of y<sup>e</sup> Doctors houses walled in with
Little gardens, their fronts Looked Gracefully; Else I saw
no house Except the present Majors house of brick and
stone, and one house which was y<sup>e</sup> Chancellors built of stone
very Lofty, 5 good sarshe windows in y<sup>e</sup> front, and this
within a Stone wall’d Garden well kept, and Iron gates to
discover it to view with stone Pillars. Ye streetes are very
broad and handsome well Pitched.</p>

<p class='c012'>I walked round the walls and saw the River w<sup>ch</sup> twists
and turns itself round the grounds, Called the Emount, w<sup>ch</sup>
at 3 or 4 miles off is flow’d by the sea. The other River is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>the Essex w<sup>ch</sup> is very broad and Ebbs and flows about a
mile or two off. There Remaines only some of the walls
and ruines of y<sup>e</sup> Castle, w<sup>ch</sup> does shew it to have been a
very strong town formerly. The walls are of a prodigious
thickness and vast great stones, its moated round and with
draw bridges. There is a Large Market place w<sup>th</sup> a good
Cross and hall, and is well supply’d as I am Inform’d w<sup>th</sup>
provision at Easye rate, but my Landlady notwithstanding
ran me up the Largest Reckoning for allmost nothing, it
was y<sup>e</sup> dearest Lodging I met with and she pretended she
Could get me nothing else; so for 2 joynts of mutton and a
pinte of wine and bread and beer I had a 12 shilling
Reckoning, but since I find tho’ I was in the biggest house
in town I was in the worst accomodation, and so found it,
and a young giddy Landlady y<sup>t</sup> Could only Dress fine and
Entertain the soldiers. From hence I tooke a guide
the next day and so went for Scotland and Rode 3
or 4 mile by y<sup>e</sup> side of this River Emount w<sup>ch</sup> is full
of very good ffish. I Rode sometymes on a high Ridge
over a hill, sometymes on the sands, it turning and winding
about that I went almost all the way by it and saw
them with boates fishing for Salmon and troute, w<sup>ch</sup> made
my journey very pleasant. Leaving this River I Came to
the Essex w<sup>ch</sup> is very broad and hazardous to Crosse Even
when the tyde is out, by which it leaves a broad sand
on Each side, which in some places is unsafe, made
me take a good guide which Carry’d me aboute and a Crosse
some part of it here, and some part in another place,
it being Deep in y<sup>e</sup> Channell where I did Crosse w<sup>ch</sup> was
in sight of y<sup>e</sup> mouth of the river that runs into the sea. On
the sand before the water was quite gone from it I saw a
great bird w<sup>ch</sup> Look’d almost black picking up ffish and
busking in the water, it Looked like an Eagle and by its
dimentions Could scarce be any other bird. Thence I went
into Scotland over the river Serke which is also flowed by
y<sup>e</sup> sea, but in the Summer tyme is not soe deep but Can be
pass’d over—tho’ pretty deep but narrow. It affords good
ffish, but all here about w<sup>ch</sup> are Called borderers seem to be
very poor people w<sup>ch</sup> I impute to their sloth. Scotland this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>part of it is a Low Marshy ground where they Cutt turff and
peate for the fewell, tho’ I should apprehend y<sup>e</sup> sea might
Convey Coales to them. I see Little that they are Employ’d
besides ffishing w<sup>ch</sup> makes provision plentifull or Else their
Cutting and Carving turff and peate, w<sup>ch</sup> the women and
great Girles bare legged does Lead a horse w<sup>ch</sup> draws a sort
of carriage, the Wheeles like a Dung-pott and hold about
4 wheele barrows. These people tho’ with naked Leggs are
yet wrapp’d up in plodds, a piece of woollen Like a Blanket,
or Else Rideing hoods—and this when they are in their
houses. I tooke them for people w<sup>ch</sup> were sick, seeing 2 or
3 great wenches as tall and bigg as any woman sat hovering
between their bed and Chimney corner, all jdle doing nothing
or at Least was not settled to any work tho’ it was nine of
the Clock when I Came thither, haveing gone 7 long miles
that morning. This is a Little Market town Called Adison
Bank the houses Look just Like the booths at a fair, I am
sure j have been in some of them that were tollerable
dwellings to these, they have no Chimneys, their smoke
Comes out all over the house and there are great holes in y<sup>e</sup>
sides of their houses w<sup>ch</sup> Letts out the smoake when they
have been well smoaked in it. There is no Roome in their
houses but is up to y<sup>e</sup> thatch and in which are 2 or 3 beds,
Even to their parlours and buttery, and notwithstanding y<sup>e</sup>
Cleaning of their parlour for me I was not able to beare the
roome; the smell of the hay was a perfume and what
I Rather Chose to stay and see my horses Eate their
provender in the stable than to stand in y<sup>t</sup> roome for
I Could not bring my self to sit down. My Landlady
offered me a good dish of ffish and brought me butter in a
Lairdly Dish with the Clap bread, but I Could have
no stomach to Eate any of the ffood they should order, and
finding they had noe wheaten bread I told her I Could not
Eate their Clapt out bread, soe I bought the ffish she got
for me w<sup>ch</sup> was full Cheape Enough, nine pence for two
pieces of Salmon halfe a one neer a yard Long, and a very
Large trout of an amber Coullour, soe drinking w<sup>th</sup> out
Eateing some of their wine w<sup>ch</sup> was Exceeding good Claret
w<sup>ch</sup> they stand Conveniently for to have from France,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and Indeed it was the best and truest Ffrench wine I have
dranck this seven year and very Clear, I had y<sup>e</sup> first tapping
of y<sup>e</sup> Little vessell and it was very fine. Then I went up to
their Church w<sup>ch</sup> Looks Rather Like some Little house built
of stone and bricke such as our ordinary people in a village
Live in. Y<sup>e</sup> doores were and y<sup>e</sup> Seates and pulpit was in so
disregarded a manner that one would have thought there
was no use of it, but there is a parson which Lives just by,
whose house is y<sup>e</sup> best in the place, and they are all fine
folks in their Sundays Cloathes. I observe y<sup>e</sup> Church yard
is full of grave stones pretty Large with Coates of armes,
and some had a Coronet on the Eschutcheons Cut in the
stone. I saw but one house that Look’d Like a house
about a quarter of a mile, w<sup>ch</sup> was some gentlemans that
was built 2 or 3 roomes and some over them of brick and
stone, the rest were all Like Barns or hutts for Cattle.
This is threescore miles from Edenborough and the neerest
town to this place is 18 miles, and there would not have
been much better entertainement or accomodation, and their
miles are soe long in these Countrys made me afraid
to venture, Least after a tedious journey I should not be
able to get a bed I Could Lye in. It seemes there are very
few towns Except Edenburough Abberdeen and Kerk w<sup>ch</sup>
Can give better treatement to strangers, therefore for
the most part persons y<sup>t</sup> travell there go from one Noblemans
house to another. Those houses are all Kind of
Castles and they Live great tho’ in so nasty a way as all
things are in even those houses one has Little Stomach to
Eate or use anything, as I have been told by some that has
travell’d there, and I am sure I mett with a sample of it
enough to discourage my progress farther in Scotland. I
attribute it wholly to their sloth for I see they sitt and
do Little. I think there were one or two at Last did take
spinning in hand at a Lazy way. Thence I tooke my ffish
to Carry it to a place for the English to dress it and
repass’d the Serke and the River Essex and there I saw y<sup>e</sup>
Common people men women and Children take off their
shooes, and holding up their Cloathes wade through the
rivers when y<sup>e</sup> tide was out, and truely some there were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>that when they Come to y<sup>e</sup> other side put on shoes
and stockings and had ffine Plodds Cast over them and
their Garb seemed above y<sup>e</sup> Common people; but this
is their Constant way of travelling from one place to
anoth<sup>r</sup>—if any river to pass they make no use of Bridges
and have not many. I Came to Long town w<sup>ch</sup> is 3
long mile from Addison Bank and is Called a Border
and Indeed is very like y<sup>e</sup> Scotsland. Thence I Cross’d
over a tedious long heath to Brampton a mile over Lime
River and here I had my dinner dress’d—thence to Mucks
hall 6 miles. Here I pass’d by my Lord Carletons which
stands in the midst of woods. You goe through Lanes and
Little sort of woods or hedge rows and many Little purling
rivers or Brooks out of y<sup>e</sup> rocks. At Muneks Hall I Cross’d
such another brooke and so out of Cumberland I Entred
Northumberland. This is y<sup>e</sup> place y<sup>e</sup> judges Dine, its
a sorry place for Entertainement of such a Company; here
the Sherriffs meete them, it being the Entrance of Northumberland
w<sup>ch</sup> is much Like the other County. This it seemes
Camden relates to be a Kingdom. This I am sure of, the
more I travell’d Northward the Longer I found y<sup>e</sup> miles, I
am sure these 6 miles and y<sup>e</sup> other 6 miles to Hartwhistle
might with modesty be esteemed double the Number in
most of y<sup>e</sup> Countys in England, Especially in and about 30
or 40 miles off London. I did not go 2 of those miles in an
hour. Just at my Entrance into Northumberland I ascended
a very steep hill of w<sup>ch</sup> there are many, but one about 2 mile
forward was Exceeding steep, full of great Rocks and stone—some
of it along on a Row (the remainder of the Picts
walls or ffortification) at y<sup>e</sup> bottom of w<sup>ch</sup> was an old Castle
the walls and towers of which was mostly Standing. Its a
sort of Black moorish ground and so wet I observ’d as my
Man Rode up that sort of precipice or steep his horses heeles
Cast up water every step, and their feete Cut deepe in, Even
quite up to y<sup>e</sup> top. Such up and down hills and sort of boggy
ground it was and y<sup>e</sup> night Drawing fast on, y<sup>e</sup> miles so
Long, that I tooke a guide to direct me to avoid those ill
places. This Hartwhistle is a Little town, there was one
Inn but they had noe hay nor would get none, and when my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>servants had got some Else where they were angry and
would not Entertaine me, so I was forced to take up in a
poor Cottage w<sup>ch</sup> was open to y<sup>e</sup> Thatch and no partitions
but hurdles plaistered. Indeed y<sup>e</sup> Loft as they Called it
w<sup>ch</sup> was over the other roomes was shelter’d but w<sup>th</sup> a hurdle;
here I was fforced to take up my abode and y<sup>e</sup> Landlady
brought me out her best sheetes w<sup>ch</sup> serv’d to secure my
own sheetes from her dirty blanckets, and Indeed I had her
fine sheete to spread over y<sup>e</sup> top of the Clothes; but noe
sleepe Could I get, they burning turff and their Chimneys
are sort of fflews or open tunnills, y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> smoake does annoy
the roomes. This is but 12 miles from another part of Scotland,
the houses are but a Little better built, its true
the inside of them are kept a Little better. Not far from
this a Mile or two is a greate hill from which rises 3 rivers:
the Teese w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> border between Durham and York, y<sup>e</sup>
Ouse that runns to Yorke, and the River Tyne which runns
to NewCastle and is the divider of Northumberland and
Durham. This river Tyne runns 7 miles and then joyns w<sup>th</sup>
the other river Tyne that Comes out of Northumberland
and so they run on to NewCastle. From Hartwhistle I went
pretty much up hill and down and had the River Tyne
much in view for 6 miles, then I cross’d over it on a Large
stone bridge and so Rode by its bank or pretty much
in sight of it on the other side to Hexholme 6 mile more.
This is one of the best towns in Northumberland Except
NewCastle, w<sup>ch</sup> is one place the Sessions are kept for
the shire; its built of Stone and looks very well, there are
2 gates to it, many streetes, some are pretty broad, all well
pitch’d, w<sup>th</sup> a spacious Market place w<sup>th</sup> a town hall on the
Market Crosse. Thence I went through y<sup>e</sup> Lord Darentwaters
parke just by his house w<sup>ch</sup> is an old building not
very Large, for 3 mile in all, to a Little village where
I cross’d over the Tyne on a Long Bridge of stone w<sup>th</sup>
many arches. The river is in some places broader than in
others, its true at this tyme of y<sup>e</sup> yeare being Midsumer the
springs are the Lowest and the Rivers shallow, and
where there is any Rocks or stones Left quite bare of water.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I went 4 mile along by the Tyne, the road was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>good hard gravelly way for the most part, but very steep
up hills and down; on one of these I Rode a pretty while
w<sup>th</sup> a great precipice on the Right hand down to the river,
it Looked hazardous, but the way was very broad. The
River Looked very reffreshing and y<sup>e</sup> Cattle Coming to its
sides and into it where shallow to Coole themselves in the
heate, for hitherto as I met w<sup>th</sup> noe Raines, notwithstanding
the great raines y<sup>t</sup> fell the 2 dayes before I Left Woolsley,
and y<sup>e</sup> Little showers I had when I went to Hollywell I
was not annoy’d w<sup>th</sup> wet nor Extream heat, the Clouds
being a shade to me by day and Gods good providence and
protection all wayes. This after noon was the hottest day I
met with but it was seasonable being in July. As I drew
nearer and nearer to NewCastle I met with and saw
abundance of Little Carriages w<sup>th</sup> a yoke of oxen and a
pair of horses together, w<sup>ch</sup> is to Convey the Coales from y<sup>e</sup>
pitts to y<sup>e</sup> Barges on the river. There is Little sort of
Dung-potts. I suppose they hold not above 2 or three
Chaudron. This is the sea Coale which is pretty much
small Coale tho’ some is round Coales, yet none like the
Cleft coales and this is what y<sup>e</sup> smiths use and it Cakes in
y<sup>e</sup> ffire and makes a great heate, but it burns not up Light
unless you put most round Coales w<sup>ch</sup> will burn Light, but
then its soon gone and that part of y<sup>e</sup> Coale never Cakes,
there fore y<sup>e</sup> small sort is as good as any—if its black and
shineing, that shows its goodness. This Country all about
is full of this Coale, y<sup>e</sup> sulpher of it taints y<sup>e</sup> aire and it
smells strongly to strangers,—upon a high hill 2 mile from
NewCastle I could see all about the Country w<sup>ch</sup> was full
of Coale pitts.</p>

<p class='c012'>New-Castle Lies in a bottom very Low, it appears
from this hill a greate fflatt. I saw all by the river Tyne
w<sup>ch</sup> runns along to Tinmouth 5 or 6 miles off, w<sup>ch</sup> Could see
very plaine and y<sup>e</sup> Scheld w<sup>ch</sup> is the key or ffort at the
mouth of y<sup>e</sup> river w<sup>ch</sup> disembogues itself into y<sup>e</sup> sea; all
this was in view on this high hill w<sup>ch</sup> I descended—5 mile
more, in all nine from that place.</p>

<p class='c012'>NewCastle is a town and County of itself standing part
in Northumberland part in y<sup>e</sup> Bishoprick of Durham, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>river Tyne being y<sup>e</sup> division. Its a noble town tho’ in a
bottom, it most resembles London of any place in England,
its buildings Lofty and Large, of brick mostly or stone.
The streetes are very broad and handsome and very well
pitch’d, and many of them w<sup>th</sup> very ffine Cunduits of water
in Each allwayes running into a Large stone Cistern for
Every bodyes use. There is one great streete where in y<sup>e</sup>
Market Crosse, there was one great Cunduit with two spouts
w<sup>ch</sup> falls into a Large ffountaine paved w<sup>th</sup> stone which held
at Least 2 or 3 hodsheads for the jnhabitants. There are 4
gates w<sup>ch</sup> are all Double gates with a sort of Bridge between
Each. The west gate w<sup>ch</sup> I entred I came by a Large
building of bricke within bricke walls, which is the hall for
the assizes and sessions for the shire of Northumberland.
This is NewCastle on y<sup>e</sup> Tyne and is a town and County.
There is a noble Building in the middle of the town all of
stone for an Exchange on stone pillars severall rows. On
the top is a building of a very Large hall for the judges to
keep the assizes for the town; there is another roome for
y<sup>e</sup> Major and Councill and another for the jury out of the
Large roome w<sup>ch</sup> is the hall, and opens into a Balcony w<sup>ch</sup>
Looks out on y<sup>e</sup> River and y<sup>e</sup> Key. Its a Lofty good
building of stone, very uniforme on all sides w<sup>th</sup> stone
pillars in the ffronts both to the streete and market place
and to the waterside. There is a ffine Clock on the top
just as y<sup>e</sup> Royal Exchange has. The Key is a very ffine
place and Lookes itself Like an Exchange being very
broad and soe full of merchants walking to and againe, and
it runs off a great Length w<sup>th</sup> a great many steps down to
y<sup>e</sup> water for the Conveniency of Landing or boateing their
goods, and is full of Cellars or ware houses. Ye harbour
is full of shipps but none that is above 2 or 300 tun Can
Come up quite to the Key: its a town of greate trade.
There is one Large Church built of stone w<sup>th</sup> a very high
tower finely Carv’d full of spires and severall devises in the
Carving—all stone. The Quire is neate as is the whole
Church and Curious Carving in wood on each side the
quire, and over the ffront is a great Piramidy of wood
ffinely Carv’d full of spires. There was a Castle in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>town but now there is noe remaines of it but some of y<sup>e</sup>
walls w<sup>ch</sup> are built up in houses and soe only appears as a
great hill or ascent, w<sup>ch</sup> in some places is 30 or 40 steps
advance to the streetes that are built on y<sup>e</sup> higher ground
where the Castle was. There was one place soe Like Snow
Hill in London w<sup>th</sup> a fine Conduite. Their shops are good
and are of Distinct trades, not selling many things in one
shop as is y<sup>e</sup> Custom in most Country towns and Cittys;
here is one market for Corne, another for Hay, besides all
other things w<sup>ch</sup> takes up two or three streetes. Satturday
was their biggest Market day w<sup>ch</sup> was the Day I was there,
and by Reason of the extreame heate resolved to stay till
the sun was Low ere I proceeded farther, so had the
opportunity of seeing most of the Market w<sup>ch</sup> is Like a
ffaire for all sorts of provision, and good and very Cheape.
I saw one buy a quarter of Lamb ffor 3<sup>d</sup> and 2<sup>d</sup> a piece:
good Large poultry. Here is Leather, Woollen and Linnen
and all sorts of stands for baubles. They have a very
jndifferent sort of Cheese—Little things, Looks black on
the outside. There is a very pleasant bowling-green, a
Little walke out of the town w<sup>th</sup> a Large gravel walke
round it w<sup>th</sup> two Rows of trees on Each side Makeing it
very shady: there is a fine entertaineing house y<sup>t</sup> makes
up the ffourth side, before w<sup>ch</sup> is a paved walke and
Epyasses of bricke. There is a pretty Garden, by y<sup>e</sup> side a
shady walk, its a sort of spring garden where the Gentlemen
and Ladyes walke in the Evening—there is a green house
in the garden, its a pleasant walke to the town by y<sup>e</sup> walls.
There is one broad walke by the side of y<sup>e</sup> town runns a
good Length made w<sup>th</sup> Coale ashes and so well trodden,
and the raines makes it firm. There is a walke all round
the walls of the town. There is a good ffree school and 5
Churches. I went to see the Barber Surgeons Hall w<sup>ch</sup> was
within a pretty garden walled in, full of flowers and greens
In potts and in the Borders; its a good neate building of
Brick. There I saw the roome w<sup>th</sup> a round table in it
railed round w<sup>th</sup> seates or Benches for y<sup>e</sup> Conveniency in
their disecting and anatomiseing a body, and reading
Lectures on all parts. There was two bodyes that had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>been anatomised, one the bones were fastned w<sup>th</sup> wires the
other had had the flesh boyled off and so some of y<sup>e</sup>
Ligeament remained and dryed w<sup>th</sup> it, and so the parts
were held together by its own Muscles and sinews that were
dryed w<sup>th</sup> it. Over this was another roome in w<sup>ch</sup> was the
skin of a man that was taken off after he was dead, and
dressed, and so was stuff’d—the body and Limbs. It
Look’d and felt Like a sort of parchment. In this roome I
Could take a view of the whole town, it standing on high
ground and a pretty Lofty building.</p>

<p class='c012'>Just by is a very good Hospital for 14 widdows of
tradesmen of the town, 2 good roomes a piece, a walke
under a pyasse w<sup>th</sup> pillars of brickwork, as is the whole
building: there is a Large ffountaine or Cunduite of water
for their use and an open Green before their house all
walled in, its in y<sup>e</sup> major and aldermans disposition, there is
2 or 300 pound a yeare to it, I thinke its 10 pound a piece.
There is a very good fountaine belongs to it, and there is a
fine bridge over the Tyne river w<sup>th</sup> 9 arches all built on as
London bridge is, which Enters you into Durham, and on
this side of y<sup>e</sup> Bridge are so many streets and buildings
just Like Southwarke. Its a Little town but all is in the
Liberty of y<sup>e</sup> County town of New-Castle and soe Called,
but its all in the Diocess of Durham. Through part of
this you do ascend a greate height and steepness w<sup>ch</sup> is full
of Rocky stony stepps, and afterwards the hill Continues
when out of y<sup>e</sup> town till it has set you as high as on the
former hill on the other side the town—w<sup>ch</sup> I Entred out
of Northumberland—and as that gave a Large prospect of
the town and whole Country aboute on that side, soe this
gives as pleasing a sight of it on this side and the whole
river and shipps in the harbour. Thence I proceeded a
most pleasant gravell Road on the Ridge of y<sup>e</sup> hill and had
the whole Country in view, w<sup>ch</sup> seems much on a flatt to
this place, tho’ there be a few Little steep up hills and
descents, but the whole Country Looks Like a fruitfull
woody place and seemes to Equal most Countys in England.
7 mile to Chester streete w<sup>ch</sup> is a Little Market town, and I
Rode neare Lumly Castle w<sup>ch</sup> gives title and name to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Lord Lumly: the buildings Looke very Nobly, its in a 4
square tower running up to the top w<sup>th</sup> three Round towers
at the top between the windows—Lookes well—its a front
the four wayes, its not finely ffurnish’d.</p>

<p class='c012'>At this Little Market town I pass’d over the River Weire
w<sup>ch</sup> runns to Durham, w<sup>ch</sup> is 7 mile farther over a pleasant
Road and Country y<sup>t</sup> resembles Black heath, you see the
towns and Countrys Round full of Woods. One sees the
Citty of Durham four mile off from a high hill, not but the
Citty stands on a great rise of Ground and is a mile and
halfe in Length. The river runs almost round the town and
returns againe, that Casts the Citty into a tryangular; its
not Navigeable nor possible to be made so because its so
full of Rocks and vast stones, makes it difficult for any such
attempt. Durham Citty stands on a great hill, the middle
part much higher than the rest, the Cathedrall and Castle
w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> pallace w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Colledge and all the houses of the
Doctors of the Churches is altogether built of stone and all
Encompass’d w<sup>th</sup> a wall full of battlements above the walke,
and this is about the middle of y<sup>e</sup> hill w<sup>ch</sup> is a Round hill,
and a steep descent into the rest of the town, where is the
market place w<sup>ch</sup> is a spacious place, and a very ffaire town
hall on stone Pillars and a very Large Cunduite. From
this all the streets are in a pretty greate descent to y<sup>e</sup> river,
which Lookes very pleasant by meanes of its turning and
winding to and agen, and so there are 3 Large Stone
Bridges w<sup>th</sup> severall arches apiece. The abbey or y<sup>e</sup>
Cathedrall is very Large, the quire is good but nothing
Extraordinary, some good painting in the Glass of the
windows and wood Carving. There is over y<sup>e</sup> alter a painting
of a Large Catherine Wheele which Encompasses the
whole window and fills it up. The Bishops seate has
severall steps up, its Called y<sup>e</sup> throne, with a Cloth of Gold
Carpet before it. The seate was King Charles the first, of
Crimson damaske. A good organ and a fine Clock in w<sup>ch</sup>
is the signes, w<sup>th</sup> Chimes, and finely Carved w<sup>th</sup> four
pirramidy spires on Each Corner, a much Larger and
higher one in the middle well Carv’d and painted. The
ffont is of marble, the top was Carv’d wood very high, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>terminates in a poynt and resembles the picture of y<sup>e</sup> Building
of Babel—its not painted. The Cloysters are good. A
Chapple Called S<sup>t</sup> Marys now used for to keep their spiritual
Courts, and in the vestry I saw severall fine Embroyder’d
Coapes—3 or 4, I saw one above the rest was so Richly
Embroider’d w<sup>th</sup> the whole Description of Christs nativity,
Life, Death and ascention; this is put on the Deanes
shoulders at the administration of the Lords supper, here is
y<sup>e</sup> only place that they use these things in England, and
severall more Cerimonyes and Rites retained from the tymes
of popery. There are many papists in the town, popishly
affected, and daily encrease. There was great striveing in
the Choice of the parliament men, w<sup>ch</sup> I had the trouble of
in most of my journeys, y<sup>e</sup> Randan they made in the
publick houses, jndeed I happen’d to get into a quiet good
jnn a good accomodation, two Maiden sisters and brother
kept it—at y<sup>e</sup> Naggs head.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Castle w<sup>ch</sup> is the Bishops pallace stands on a Round
hill w<sup>ch</sup> has severall green walks round it, w<sup>th</sup> high bancks
to secure them one above another, and on the top are the
towers. About the Middle of the hill is a broad Grass walk
railed in and enters into a Dineing roome. There are very
stately good roomes, parlours, drawing roomes, and a noble
Hall, but the ffurniture was not very ffine the best being
taken down in the absence of my Lord Crew, who is not a
Barron of England but is a great prince as being Bishop of
the whole principallity off Durham, and has a great Royalty
and authority, is as an absolute Prince and has a great Command
as well as revenue; his Spirituall is 5 or 6000<sup>lb</sup> and
his temporalls since his brothers Death makes it much more.
He Comes sometymes hither but for the most part Lives at
another Castle w<sup>ch</sup> is a noble seate about 12 mile off, which
is very well ffurnish’d and ffinish’d; he is the Governour as
it were of the whole province. His pallace here makes a
good appearance w<sup>th</sup> the severall walks one below another
with rows of trees, three or four descents and y<sup>e</sup> wall at the
bottom. Just by the Castle is a place for the assizes, 2 open
barrs Lookes out into what is the space the College and
Doctors houses are, and there is in the Middle a very ffine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Large Cunduite, the water falling into the Cistern from 4
pipes, w<sup>ch</sup> gives a pleaseing sound and prospect, it being
arch’d with stone, and stone pillars, and Carv’d, and alsoe a
high top arch ending in a ball; its the ffinest of this kind I
have seen and so I must say of the whole Citty of Durham,
its the noblest—Cleane and pleasant buildings, streetes
Large, well pitch’d. The market Crosse is Large, a fflatt
Roofe on severall Rows of Pillars of Stone and here is a
good Cundit alsoe of stone. The walks are very pleasant
by the river side. I went by its banck of one end of the
town to the meeteing house w<sup>ch</sup> stands just by the River,
there was a Company of hearers at Least 300, w<sup>ch</sup> on the
Consideration of its being under the Dropings of y<sup>e</sup>
Cathedrall its very well. They have a very good minister
there, but its New-Castle that has the greate meeteing place
and many Descenters; they have two very Eminent men
one of their Name was D<sup>r</sup> Gilpin whose book I have read
in, but he not being at home Could not have the advantage
of hearing him.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the Evening I walk’d out at Durham to another part of
the town, by another turn of the river along by its Banck,
and the river here would meete were it not for a Ridge
of a hill runs between, it in w<sup>ch</sup> are buildings and ascends
up a mile in Length, w<sup>ch</sup> is one of the Parishes. In walking
by this river we Came to S<sup>r</sup> Charles Musgroves House w<sup>ch</sup>
is now old and ruinous but has been good. The Gardens
are flourishing still w<sup>th</sup> good walks and much ffruite of w<sup>ch</sup>
I tasted; its a place that is used Like our Spring Gardens
for the Company of the town to walk in the Evening, and
its most pleasant by the river, w<sup>ch</sup> by means of severall bays
or wires which is of Rock, the waters has greate falls from
thence, w<sup>ch</sup> adds a murmuring sound acceptable to the
people passing. They have good ffish in the river but its
full of rocks; they talk much of makeing it Navigeable but
I ffancy the many Rocks all along in it will render it a
Difficult work. I went a mile to see the spaw waters and
to see a salt spring in the Rock in the middle of y<sup>e</sup> river.
In halfe a mile I came to a well w<sup>ch</sup> had a stone Bason in it
and an arch of stone over it; the taste was Like y<sup>e</sup> Sweete
Spaw in Yorkshire and the Tunbridge waters.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span> About halfe a mile farther I Came to a well w<sup>ch</sup> is Like
the Sulpher Spaw, taste and Looke agreeing thereto, w<sup>ch</sup> is
from brimstone, but its not quite soe strong for it was
a Longer tyme before the silver was Changed in it. Here
I went a very bad and hazardous passage full of stones
Like stepps, the water trilling Down them, and a very
narrow passage by the Bushes and Bancks, but when
I was got in there was noe returning, so on I went
to the river w<sup>ch</sup> was a Large step to goe down into,
and all the river full of Shelves and Rocks.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Spring is in the Cleft of the Rocks w<sup>ch</sup> stands up in
the river, and soe springs up, but when much raines falls it
washes down soe fast upon it that weakens the taste.
From this place I came back againe a mile. Durham
has about 7 Churches w<sup>th</sup> the Cathedrall, its a noble place
and the aire so Cleer and healthy that persons Enjoy much
health and pleasure. From thence to Darlington w<sup>ch</sup> is
14 pretty Long miles but good way, but by the way I Lost
some of my nightCloths and Little things in a Bundle that
the Guide I hired Carry’d. This is a Little Market town,
the Market day was on Munday w<sup>ch</sup> was the day I
passed through it: it was a great Market of all things,
a great quantety of Cattle of all sorts but mostly Beeves—it
seemes once in a fortnight its much fuller. Two miles
from Darlington I Came to the Ground the Hell Kettles
are they talk much of, its in Grounds just by the road where
Cattle were ffeeding, there are 2 pooles or ponds of Water
the one Larger than y<sup>e</sup> other; y<sup>e</sup> biggest seemed to me not
to be the Deepest nor is it Esteem’d soe deep; there was
some sedge or flaggs growing round that, but y<sup>e</sup> fathermost
w<sup>ch</sup> was not soe bigg Looked a Cross that had noe flaggs or
sedge on its bancks but yet it Look’d to me to Cast
a green hew, Roleing waves of the water just in Coullour as
the sea, and as the wind moved the water it very much
resembled the sea, but the water when taken up in y<sup>e</sup> hand
Look’d White and y<sup>e</sup> taste was not the Least brackish
but fresh. My Conception of the Cause of y<sup>e</sup> greenish
Coullour was from the greate depth of water, for the reason
they Call them Hell Kettles is that there is noe sounding a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>bottom, w<sup>ch</sup> has been try’d by plumet and Line severall
ffathoms down; the water is Cold and as any other water
when took up, it seemes not to Decrease in a tyme of
Drought nor to advance w<sup>th</sup> great raines, it draines itself
insensibly into y<sup>e</sup> ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>This Leads me the ffarthest way to Richmond it being
but 8 mile the ready Road from Darlington to Richmond,
but this way it was 10 miles and very tedious miles. Three
miles off Darlington I passed over Crafton Bridge which
Crosses y<sup>e</sup> river Teese which Divides Durham ffrom Yorkshire,
and soe Entred the North Rideing of Yorkshire in
which is that they Call Richmondshire a shire of 30 miles.
The way was good but Long, I went through Lanes
and woods an Enclosed Country; I passed by a house of S<sup>r</sup>
Mark Melborn on a hill, a Brick building and severall
towers on the top, good gardens and severall rows of trees
up to the house, it standing on a hill, y<sup>e</sup> trees Runns along
on y<sup>e</sup> Ridge of y<sup>e</sup> same—Looks very finely.</p>

<p class='c012'>Richmondshire has in it 5 waking takes as they Call them,
answerable to that they Call hundreds in other Countys;
Each waking takes has market towns in them and are under
a Baliffe Each, which are nominated by the Earle of
Holderness who is the Sole Lord of the whole—its 30 mile
in Extent. Richmond town one cannot see till just upon
it, being Encompass’d w<sup>th</sup> great high hills: I descended a
very steep hill to it from whence saw the whole town which
itself stands on a hill tho’ not so high as these by it. Its
buildings are all stone, y<sup>e</sup> streetes are Like rocks themselves,
there is a very Large space for the Markets w<sup>ch</sup> are Divided
for the ffish market, fflesh market, and Corn; there is a
Large market Crosse, a square space walled in with severall
steps up, and its flatt on the top and of a good height.
There is by it a Large Church and the ruines of a Castle,
the pieces of the walls on a hill. I walked round by
the walls, the River running beneath a great descent to it,
its full of stones and Rocks and soe very Easye to Make or
keep up their wires or falls of water, w<sup>ch</sup> in some places is
naturall y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> water falls over Rocks w<sup>th</sup> great force w<sup>ch</sup> is
Convenient for Catching Salmon by speare when they Leap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>over those Bayes. All rivers are Low and Dryer in the
Summer soe I saw them at the greatest disadvantage being
in some places almost drye and the Rocks and stones appear
bare, but by those high and Large stone bridges I pass’d w<sup>ch</sup>
Lay aCross the Rivers shewd the Great Depth and breadth
they used to be y<sup>e</sup> Winter tymes. There was two good
houses in y<sup>e</sup> town, one was M<sup>r</sup> Darcys the Earle of Holderness’
brother, the other was M<sup>r</sup> Yorkes, both stood then and
were Chosen Parliament men. They had good gardens
walled in, all stone, as in the whole town, though I must say
it Looks Like a sad shatter’d town and fallen much to
Decay and Like a Disregarded place. I passed on towards
Burrowbridge and Came not farre from Hornby Castle the
Earle of Holderness, and also Suddber hall 2 mile off
Richmond M<sup>r</sup> Darcys house; this Road was much on Lanes
w<sup>ch</sup> were narrow but Exceeding Long, some 3 or 4 mile
before you Came to any open place and then I Came
to a Common w<sup>ch</sup> was as tedious to me, at Least 5 or 6 mile
before I Came to an End of it, then I pass’d through a few
Little villages and so I Came the 19 mile to Burrowbridge
in Yorkshire. Here I was the most sensible of the Long
Yorkshire Miles, this North Rideing of that County is much
Longer Miles than the other parts which I had been in
before. At Burrowbridge I pass’d the River Lid or Ouse
on a Large stone Bridge: this River affords very good ffish,
salmon and Codffish and plenty of Crawffish. Here I met
w<sup>th</sup> the Clutter of y<sup>e</sup> Chooseing Parliament men. Thence I
went for Knarsebrough 5 mile more; this dayes journey was
a Long 24 miles, jndeed y<sup>e</sup> wayes were very good and drye
being y<sup>e</sup> midst of summer. Here I Came to my old Landlady
Mason where I Lay the yeare before to Drink the spaw,
and from thence I went to Harragate over Knarsbrough
fforest to Leeds 12 mile, and I went by Harwood Castle—the
ruined walls some remaines. It was much in Lanes and
uphills and Down hills, some Little part was open Common;
on the Hill that Leads down to the town gives a pleaseing
prospect of it. Leeds is a Large town, severall Large
streetes, Cleane and well pitch’d and good houses all built
of stone. Some have good Gardens and Steps up to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>houses and walls before them. This is Esteemed the
Wealthyest town of its bigness in the Country its manufacture
is y<sup>e</sup> woollen Cloth—the Yorkshire Cloth in w<sup>ch</sup> they
are all Employ’d and are Esteemed very Rich and very
proud. They have provision soe plentiful y<sup>t</sup> they may Live
w<sup>th</sup> very Little Expense and get much variety; here if one
Calls for a tankard of Ale w<sup>ch</sup> is allwayes a groate its
the only dear thing all over Yorkshire, their ale is very
strong, but for paying this Groat for yo<sup>ur</sup> ale you may have
a slice of meate Either hott or Cold according to the tyme
of day you Call, or Else butter and Cheese Gratis into the
bargaine; this was a Generall Custom in most parts of
Yorkshire but now they have almost Changed it, and tho’
they still retaine the great price for the ale, yet Make
strangers pay for their meate, and at some places at great
rates, notwithstanding how Cheape they have all their provision.
There is still this Custome on a Market day at
Leeds, the sign of ye bush just by the Bridge, any body y<sup>t</sup>
will goe and Call for one tanchard of ale and a pinte of wine
and pay for these only shall be set to a table to Eate w<sup>th</sup> 2
or 3 dishes of good meate and a dish of sweetmeates after.
Had I known this and y<sup>e</sup> Day w<sup>ch</sup> was their Market I
would have Come then but I happened to Come a day after
y<sup>e</sup> market, however I did only pay for 3 tankards of ale and
w<sup>t</sup> I Eate, and my servants was gratis. This town is full of
discenters, there are 2 Large meeting places, here is also a
good schoole for young Gentlewomen; the streetes are very
broad, the Market Large. Thence I went to Eland 12 long
mile more pretty much steep, up hills and down the same.
I crossed over a River at Leeds on a Large stone bridge; y<sup>e</sup>
Country is much on Enclosures, good ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>I goe by quarreys of stone and pitts of Coales w<sup>ch</sup> are
both very good, soe that for fewell and building as well as
good grounds for feeding Cattle and for Corne they are
so well provided that together with their Industry they
must needs be very Rich. All the hills about Eland is full of
jnclosures and Coverts of wood y<sup>t</sup> Looks very pleasant. This
town gives title to y<sup>e</sup> Marquis Hallifax son, as does Hallifax
to y<sup>e</sup> Marquis. This Lyes but 5 or 6 mile hence, its a stony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>town and the roads to it soe stony and difficult y<sup>t</sup> I was
Discouraged in going, the town now being almost ruined
and Come to Decay, and y<sup>e</sup> Engine that that town was
famous for to behead their Criminalls at one stroake w<sup>th</sup> a
pully this was destroyed since their Charter or Liberty was
Lost or taken from them, because most barbarously and
rigourously acted Even w<sup>th</sup> an absolute power w<sup>ch</sup> they had
of all y<sup>e</sup> town; on those Informations I resolved not to goe
to that ragged town tho’ there are many good people and
a Large meeteing.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Eland I went to y<sup>e</sup> Blackstone Edge 8 mile, when
I had gone 3 of the miles I Came to a great Precipice or
vast descent of a hill as full of stones as if paved and
Exceedingly steep; I take it to be much steeper than
Blackstone Edge tho’ not soe long. Y<sup>e</sup> End of this steep
was a Little village all stony alsoe. These parts have
some resemblance to Darbyshire only here are more woody
places and jnclosures. Then I Came to Blackstone Edge
noted all over England for a dismal high precipice and
steep in the ascent and descent on Either End; its a very
moorish ground all about and Even just at the top, tho’ so
high, that you travel on a Causey w<sup>ch</sup> is very troublesome
as its a moist ground soe as is usual on these high hills;
they stagnate the aire and hold mist and raines almost
perpetually. As I ascended, y<sup>e</sup> Morning was pretty faire,
but a sort of mist met me and small raine just as I attained
y<sup>e</sup> top, w<sup>ch</sup> made me feare a wet day and y<sup>t</sup> the aire would
have been so thick to have quite Lost me y<sup>e</sup> sight of y<sup>e</sup>
Country, but when I attained y<sup>e</sup> top where is a great heap
raised up w<sup>ch</sup> parts Yorkshire—and there I entred Lancashire—the
mist began to Lessen, and as I descended on
this side y<sup>e</sup> ffog more and more went off and a Little raine
fell tho’ at a Little distance in our view, the sun shone on
y<sup>e</sup> vale w<sup>ch</sup> Indeed is of a Large Extent here, and y<sup>e</sup>
advantage of soe high a hill w<sup>ch</sup> is at Least 2 mile up
discovers the grounds beneath as a fruitfull valley full of
jnclosures and Cut hedges and trees. That w<sup>ch</sup> adds to the
formidableness of Blackstone Edge is that on y<sup>e</sup> one hand
you have a vast precipice almost the whole way both as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>one ascends and descends, and in some places y<sup>e</sup> precipice
is on Either hand. This hill took me up Much tyme to
gaine the top and alsoe to descend it and put me in mind
of the Description of y<sup>e</sup> Alpes in Italy, where the Clouds
drive all about and as it were below them, w<sup>ch</sup> descends
Lower into Mists, then into raines and soe tho’ on the top
it hold snow and haile falling on the passengers, w<sup>ch</sup> at
Length the Lower they go Comes into raine and so into
sun-shine—at the foote of those valleys, fruitfull, y<sup>e</sup> sunshine
and singing of birds. This was y<sup>e</sup> accō My father gave of
those Alps when he passed them and I Could not but
think this Carryed some resemblance tho’ in Little, yet a
proportion to that.</p>

<p class='c012'>From y<sup>e</sup> foot of this Blackstone I went to Rochdale
4 mile, a pretty neate town built all of stone; here I went
to an acquaintances house M<sup>r</sup> Taylor and was Civilly
Entertained. Here is a good Large Meeteing place well
filled; these parts Religion does better flourish than in
places where they have better advantages. Here I observ’d
the Grounds were all Enclosed with Quicksetts Cut smoothe
and as Even on fine Green Bancks, and as well kept as for
a Garden, and so most of my way to Manchester I Rode
between such hedges, its a thing remarked by most their
great Curiosity in this kind.</p>

<p class='c012'>Manchester Lookes exceedingly well at the Entrance,—very
substantiall buildings, the houses are not very Lofty
but mostly of Brick and stone, the old houses are timber
work; there is a very Large Church all stone and stands
high soe that walking round the Churchyard you see the
whole town. There is good Carving in wood in the Quire
of y<sup>e</sup> Church and severall Little Chappells where in are
some Little Monuments; there is one that was y<sup>e</sup> founder
of y<sup>e</sup> Colledge and Library where hangs his pictures, for
just by the Church is the Colledge w<sup>ch</sup> is a pretty neate
building w<sup>th</sup> a Large space for y<sup>e</sup> boys to play in, and a
good Garden walled in; there are 60 blew Coate boys in it,
I saw their appartments and was in the Cellars and Dranke
of their beer w<sup>ch</sup> was very good; I alsoe saw y<sup>e</sup> Kitchen and
saw their bread Cutting for their supper and their piggins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>for their beer. There is a Cloyster round a Court, in it
is a Large roome for y<sup>e</sup> judges to Eate in, and also for y<sup>e</sup>
roomes for heareing and dispatching their buissness, there is
a Large Library—2 Long walls full of books on Each side,—there
is alsoe y<sup>e</sup> globes at y<sup>e</sup> End and Maps, there is alsoe
a Long whispering trumpet, and there I saw y<sup>e</sup> skinn of y<sup>e</sup>
Rattle Snake 6 ffoote Long w<sup>th</sup> many other Curiositys,
their anatomy of a man wired together, a jaw of a shark;
there was a very ffine Clock and weather glass. Out of
y<sup>e</sup> Library there are Leads on w<sup>ch</sup> one has the sight of y<sup>e</sup>
town w<sup>ch</sup> is Large, as alsoe y<sup>e</sup> other town that Lyes below
it Called Salfor and is Divided from this by the river
Ouall over w<sup>ch</sup> is a stone bridge w<sup>th</sup> many arches. Salfor
has only a Little Chappell of Ease and is belonging to y<sup>e</sup>
Parish of Manchester.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is another river Called the Shark w<sup>ch</sup> runs into y<sup>e</sup>
Uval. The market place is Large, it takes up two streetes
Length when the Market is kept for their Linnen Cloth,
Cottentickings w<sup>th</sup> is the manufacture of y<sup>e</sup> town. Here
is a very fine Schoole for young Gentlewomen as
good as any in London, and musick and danceing and
things are very plenty here—this is a thriveing place.
Hence I went a very pleasant roade Much on y<sup>e</sup> downs
mostly Campion ground, some few Enclosures, I went by
Dunum the Earle of Warringtons house w<sup>ch</sup> stands in a
very fine parcke, it stands Low but appeared very well to
sight, its old fashioned building w<sup>ch</sup> appeares more in y<sup>e</sup>
Inside, and the furniture old, but good gardens walled in.
I also passed by severall Gentlemens seates, one was M<sup>r</sup>
Cholmonlys, another M<sup>r</sup> Listers, surrounded w<sup>th</sup> good
Walks and shady trees in rows, and severall Large pooles
of water some Containeing severall acres. I passed over
two or three stone bridges Cross Little rivers, so to
Norwitch w<sup>ch</sup> is 14 mile. I Entred Cheshire 3 mile before
I Came to y<sup>e</sup> town, its not very Large, its full of Salt works
the brine pitts being all here about, and so they make
all things Convenient to follow y<sup>e</sup> makeing the salt so
y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> town is full of smoak from y<sup>e</sup> salterns on all sides.
They have within these few yeares found in their brine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>pitts a hard Rocky salt that Lookes Cleer Like Suger
Candy and its taste shews it to be salt, they Call this Rock
salt, it will make very good brine w<sup>th</sup> fresh water to use
quickly. This they Carry to the water side into Wales
and by those Rivers that are flow’d w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> tyde, and soe
they boile these pieces of Rock in some of the salt water
when y<sup>e</sup> tyde’s in, w<sup>ch</sup> produces as strong and good salt as
the others. Thence I went to Sandy head 3 mile farther.
There was 12 salterns together at Norwitch—all y<sup>e</sup> witches
are places they make salt in—Nantwitch and Droctwitch
they make salt, for at Each place they have the salt hills
where the brine pits springs: this is not farre from y<sup>e</sup> place
whence they digg the mill stones.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Sandy Lane head where I baited, to Whit Church
is 16 long miles over a Long heath for 4 or 5 mile, then to
Bestonwood and Came by Beston Castle on a very high
hill, y<sup>e</sup> walls remaineing round it, w<sup>ch</sup> I Left a Little on my
Right hand just at y<sup>e</sup> foote of y<sup>e</sup> hill, and so I Crossed y<sup>e</sup>
great Road w<sup>ch</sup> Comes from Nantwitch to Chester being
then just y<sup>e</sup> midd way to Either, being 7 mile to Each.
There I think I may say was y<sup>e</sup> only tyme I had reason to
suspect I was Engaged w<sup>th</sup> some highway men. 2 fellows
all on a suddain from y<sup>e</sup> wood fell into y<sup>e</sup> Road, they Look’d
truss’d up w<sup>th</sup> great Coates and as it were bundles about
them w<sup>ch</sup> I believe was pistolls, but they dogg’d me one
before y<sup>e</sup> other behind and would often Look back to Each
other, and frequently justle my horse out of y<sup>e</sup> way to get
between one of my servants horses and mine, and when they
first Came up to us did disown their knowledge of y<sup>e</sup> way
and would often stay a little behind and talke together, then
Come up againe, but the providence of God so order’d it as
there was men at work in y<sup>e</sup> fields haymakeing, and it being
market day at WhitChurch, as I drew neer to y<sup>t</sup> in 3 or 4
mile was Continually met w<sup>th</sup> some of y<sup>e</sup> market people, so
they at Last Called Each other off and soe Left us and
turned back; but as they Rode w<sup>th</sup> us 3 or 4 miles at Last
they described the places we should Come by, and a high
pillar finely painted in y<sup>e</sup> Road about 3 mile off of Whitchurch
(w<sup>ch</sup> accordingly we saw as we pass’d on) w<sup>ch</sup> shew’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>them noe strangers to y<sup>e</sup> Road as they at first pretended.
I passed over a Little brooke a mile before I Came to
WhitChurch w<sup>ch</sup> Entred me into Shropshire. This is a
Large market town, here are two very fine gardens, one
belongs to an apothecary, full of all fruites and greens; y<sup>e</sup>
other was at y<sup>e</sup> Crown jnn where I staid, it was exceeding
neate w<sup>th</sup> oring and Lemmon trees, Mirtle, striped and gilded
hollytrees, box and ffilleroy finely Cut, and ffirrs and
merumsuratum w<sup>ch</sup> makes the fine snuff, and fine flowers
all things almost in a little tract of Garden Ground. From
thence its 14 mile to Shrewsbury and pretty Level way.
Ye miles were long and y<sup>e</sup> wind blew very Cold, I went on
a Causey 2 or 3 miles to y<sup>e</sup> town, so y<sup>t</sup> in y<sup>e</sup> winter the way
is bad and deep but on the Causey.</p>

<p class='c012'>Y<sup>e</sup> town stands Low, y<sup>e</sup> spires of 2 of y<sup>e</sup> Churches stand
high and appear Eminent above y<sup>e</sup> town, there is y<sup>e</sup>
remaines of a Castle, y<sup>e</sup> walls and battlements and some
towers w<sup>ch</sup> I walked round, from whence had y<sup>e</sup> whole view
of y<sup>e</sup> town w<sup>ch</sup> is walled round w<sup>th</sup> battlements and walks
round, some of which I went on. Its here the fine river
Severn Encompasses y<sup>e</sup> greatest part of y<sup>e</sup> town and twines
and twists its self about, its not very broad here but its very
deep and is Esteemed y<sup>e</sup> finest river in England to Carry
such a depth of water for 80 or more miles together Ere it
runns into y<sup>e</sup> sea w<sup>ch</sup> is at Bristol. This Comes out of
Wales, Ross and Monmouthshire, there it turns about and
Comes to y<sup>e</sup> town. On Each side there are 3 bridges
over it, in y<sup>e</sup> town one of them y<sup>t</sup> I walked over had some
few houses built on it, as London bridge, at one End of it.
Its pleasant to walk by y<sup>e</sup> river; there is just by it the
Councill house an old building. Here are three free
schooles together, built of free stone, 3 Large roomes to
teach the Children, w<sup>th</sup> severall masters. Y<sup>e</sup> first has 150£
a year y<sup>e</sup> second 100 y<sup>e</sup> third 50<sup>£</sup> a year and teach
Children from reading English till fit for y<sup>e</sup> University,
and its free for Children not only of y<sup>e</sup> town but for
all over England if they Exceed not y<sup>e</sup> numbers. Here
is a very fine Market Cross of stone Carv’d, in another
place there is an Exchequer or hall for y<sup>e</sup> towns affaires,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>there is alsoe a hall for y<sup>e</sup> Welsh manufacture. There is a
water house w<sup>ch</sup> supplys y<sup>e</sup> town through pipes w<sup>th</sup> water,
but its drawn up w<sup>th</sup> horses and it seemes not to be a good
and Easye way, so they jntend to make it with a water
Engine in the town. There are many good houses but
mostly old buildings, timber; there is some remaines of a
great abbey and just by it y<sup>e</sup> great Church, but nothing fine
or worth notice save y<sup>e</sup> abbey Gardens w<sup>th</sup> gravell walks set
full of all sorts of greens—orange and Lemmon trees: I
had a paper of their flowers—were very fine,—there was
alsoe ffirrs, myrtles and hollys of all sorts and a green house
full of all sorts of Curiosityes of flowers and greens—there
was y<sup>e</sup> aloes plant. Out of this went another Garden much
Larger w<sup>th</sup> severall fine grass walks kept Exactly Cut and
roled for Company to walke in. Every Wednesday most
of y<sup>e</sup> town y<sup>e</sup> Ladyes and Gentlemen walk there as in S<sup>t</sup>
James’ parke, and there are abundance of people of Quality
Lives in Shrewsbury, more than in any town Except
Nottingham; its true there are noe fine houses but there
are many Large old houses that are Convenient and stately,
and its a pleasant town to Live in and great plenty w<sup>ch</sup>
makes it Cheap Living. This is very near bordering on
Wales and was reckon’d formerly one of y<sup>e</sup> Welsh County’s
as was Herifordshire. Here is a very good schoole for young
Gentlewomen for Learning work and behaviour and musick.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Shrewsbury I went through the great ffaire w<sup>ch</sup> was
just kept that day there, full of all sorts of things and all
the roade for 10 mile at Least I met y<sup>e</sup> people and Commoditys
going to the ffaire. 2 mile thence I passed over
the River Cern on a Large stone bridge, this is deep and
joyns the Severn and soe I Rode by the great hill Called
the Reeke noted for the highest piece of ground in England,
but it must be by those that only Live in the heart of y<sup>e</sup>
Kingdom and about London, for there are much higher
hills in the north and West and alsoe not 40 mile distant
from it; Manborn hills seems vastly higher. This hill
stands just by itself a round hill and does raise its head
much above y<sup>e</sup> hills neare it, and on the one side does
Looke a great steepe down, but still my thoughts of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>ffells in Cumberland and Westmoreland are soe farr beyond
it in height that this would not be mentioned there; it is
seen 20 mile off and soe may many other hills, but when
I Rode just under it I was full Convinc’d its height was not
in Compẽtion w<sup>th</sup> those in other parts that I have seen.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are great hills all about w<sup>ch</sup> I pass’d over full of
Coale pitts. Here I Came into y<sup>e</sup> Whatling Streete w<sup>ch</sup> is
one of y<sup>e</sup> great roads of England w<sup>ch</sup> divided y<sup>e</sup> Land into
so many Kingdoms under y<sup>e</sup> Saxons. The roads are pretty
good but y<sup>e</sup> miles are Long, from Shrewsbury to y<sup>e</sup> Reeke
is 9 mile, from thence to S<sup>r</sup> Thomas Patsells house 10 mile
more; here I went to see his Gardens w<sup>ch</sup> are talk’d off as
y<sup>e</sup> finest and best kept, y<sup>e</sup> house is old and Low, if y<sup>e</sup>
Gentleman had Lived he Did design a new house, its now
his sons who is an Infant. Before you Come to y<sup>e</sup> house
for a quarter of a mile you Ride between fine Cut hedges,
and y<sup>e</sup> nearer y<sup>e</sup> approach the finer still, they are very high
and Cut Smoothe and Even just Like y<sup>e</sup> hedges at Astrop
waters, and of Each side beyond are woods, some regular
Rows, some in its native Rudeness, w<sup>th</sup> ponds beyond in
grounds beneath it. Y<sup>e</sup> End of this walke you Enter a
Large gate of open Iron grates, w<sup>th</sup> as many more jron
grates on Each side as the Breadth of y<sup>e</sup> gate, opposite to
this is just another that opens into those grounds I first
mention’d. There is a Large pitched Court w<sup>th</sup> some open
jron gates and grates at Each End, y<sup>t</sup> gives the visto quite
a Cross through to other Rows of trees w<sup>ch</sup> runs up all
about y<sup>e</sup> severall avenues.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this Court stands two Dyals between w<sup>ch</sup> is an open
gate and pallasadoes, the whole breadth of y<sup>e</sup> front of this
jron work w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to the jnner Court, and on y<sup>e</sup> other
side just in front, is another Large gate Carv’d Iron w<sup>th</sup>
pillars brick and stone and flower potts; and on Each side
to take the whole Breadth of y<sup>e</sup> house to w<sup>ch</sup> it faces and
soe give the sight of the garden is open pallisadoes, and a
Little beyond are two more such open Pallisadoes that are
Corner wayes, and discovers the Groves whose walks Looks
Every way, so y<sup>t</sup> to stand in this outward Court you May
see the house, and Court full of statues in Grass plotts, w<sup>th</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>a broad pav’d walke to the house. In y<sup>e</sup> middle on y<sup>e</sup> one
side are flower gardens and y<sup>e</sup> parke, y<sup>e</sup> other side other
grounds w<sup>th</sup> rows of trees and by it very handsome stables
and Coach houses, and then in the ffront this Large opening
to this garden where is a ffountaine all wayes playing very
high, the water, the Gravel walks, and fine flowers and
greens of all sorts in potts and on the borders. This gate I
mention’d had brick pillars w<sup>th</sup> stone heads on w<sup>ch</sup> stood a
turky Cock on each Cut in stone and painted proper. Y<sup>e</sup>
grove I mention’d is the finest I Ever saw, there are six
walks thro’ it and just in the Middle you Look twelve wayes
w<sup>ch</sup> Discovers as Many severall prospects, Either to y<sup>e</sup> house
or Entrance or fountaines or Gardens or ffields. The Grove
itself is peculiar being Composed of all sorts of greens that
hold their verdure and beauty all the yeare, and flourishes
most in y<sup>e</sup> winter season when all other Garden beautys
fades, of ffirrs, both silver, Scots, Noroway, Cyprus, Yew,
Bays &amp;c; the severall squares being set full of these Like
a Maze; they are Compassed round Each square w<sup>th</sup> a
hedge of Lawrell about a y<sup>d</sup> high Cut Exactly smooth and
Even, there are also box trees in the middle. There are
two other Large Gardens w<sup>th</sup> Gravell walkes, and grass
plotts full of stone statues, the stone is taken out of y<sup>e</sup>
quarry’s about this Country, w<sup>ch</sup> is not a very firme stone
and so the Weather Cracks them.</p>

<p class='c012'>In one of these Gardens just the side of y<sup>e</sup> house into
w<sup>ch</sup> it opens w<sup>th</sup> glass doors and just over against it is a
Large Avery of birds w<sup>th</sup> branches of trees stuck into the
Ground; by it is a Little Summer house neately painted,
beyond this is another Garden w<sup>th</sup> a broad Gravel walke
quite round. In the middle is a Long as well as Large
ffountaine or pond w<sup>ch</sup> is Called a sheete of water, at y<sup>e</sup>
four Corners are seates shelter’d behind and on y<sup>e</sup> top and
sides w<sup>th</sup> boards painted, on w<sup>ch</sup> you sit secured from the
weather, and Looks on the water w<sup>ch</sup> has 348 Lead pipes
at y<sup>e</sup> brims of it w<sup>ch</sup> takes in the sides and End and w<sup>th</sup> the
turning a sluce they streame at once into the fountaine w<sup>ch</sup>
Looks well and makes a pleaseing sound. If those pipes
were but turned in a bow it would Cast the water in an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>arch and so would augment the Beauty of y<sup>e</sup> prospect.
There are 2 Large Images stands in the Midst y<sup>t</sup> Cast out
water and 4 sea horses all Casting out water. In the other
Gardens there were Little figures w<sup>ch</sup> bedewed the borders
w<sup>th</sup> their showers.</p>

<p class='c012'>This Large pond I spoke of before is very deep and good
ffish Encreasing in it. There is another great pond in a
ground beyond, w<sup>ch</sup> Lyes to view thro’ those green pallasadoes
and is stored w<sup>th</sup> much good ffish. Thence I went
to Aubery 2 miles, a Little Market town, thence to
Pauckeridge and passed through some parcks w<sup>ch</sup> belongs
to some Gentlemens seate. I went by one M<sup>r</sup> Peirpoynts,
and S<sup>r</sup> Walter Rochlys house, w<sup>ch</sup> stands on a hill in a
thicket of trees, and soe Came againe to the Whatling-street
way and soe over Kankewood to Woolsly—in all 14
mile ffarther. From Woolsly to Haywood parke 2 mile,
and home againe 2 mile, from Woolsley to Kanktown 6
mile, thence to Woolverhampton 6 mile. I went more in
sight of S<sup>r</sup> Walter Rochly w<sup>ch</sup> stands very finely on a hill
and woods by it—Lookes very stately. These miles are
very Long thro’ Lanes. I passed by a fine house Prestwitch
M<sup>r</sup> Philip Ffolies, a pretty seate in a parke, a mile
beyond there is another house of y<sup>e</sup> same Gentlemans.
Here we had y<sup>e</sup> Inconveniency of meeteing the Sherriffs of
Staffordshire Just going to provide for y<sup>e</sup> Reception of y<sup>e</sup>
Judges and officers of y<sup>e</sup> Assizes, whose Coaches and
Retinue Meeteing our Company w<sup>ch</sup> was encreased w<sup>th</sup>
Cosen Ffiennes’ Coach and horsemen, w<sup>ch</sup> made us difficult
to pass Each other in the hollow wayes and Lanes.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to the Seven Starres where we baited, thence
2 miles ffarther we Entred out of Staffordshire into
Worcestershire to Broad water, a place where are severall
ffullers and Dyers mills.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence on y<sup>e</sup> Right hand are fforging mills for jron
works w<sup>ch</sup> belong to M<sup>r</sup> Tho: Ffolie, there is a Rocky hill in
w<sup>ch</sup> is a Roome Cut out in the Rocks.</p>

<p class='c012'>On y<sup>e</sup> Left hand you goe 7 mile to Ambusly, a very sad
heavy way all sand, you goe just at Kederminster town
End w<sup>ch</sup> is a Large town much Employ’d about y<sup>e</sup> worstead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>trade, spinning and weaving. We also Rode by S<sup>r</sup> John
Packingtons house on the Left hand on the hill just by
Droitwitch where are the 3 salt springs, divided by a ffresh
spring that runs by it; of this salt water they boyle much
salt that turns to good amount. All y<sup>e</sup> way from the
Seven Starrs where we baited to Ambusly y<sup>e</sup> Road was
full of y<sup>e</sup> Electers of y<sup>e</sup> Parliament men Coming from the
Choice of y<sup>e</sup> Knights of the Shire, w<sup>ch</sup> spake as they were
affected, some for one some for another, and some were
Larger in their judgments than others, telling their reason
much according to the good Liquors operation, and of
these people all the publick houses were filled that it was a
hard Matter to get Lodging or Entertainm<sup>t</sup>.</p>

<p class='c012'>We entered Worcester town next day just as y<sup>e</sup> Cerimony
of the Election was performing, and soe they Declared
it in favour of M<sup>r</sup> Welsh and S<sup>r</sup> John Packington.
4 mile more to this town—from broad water in all is 11
mile. Worcester town w<sup>ch</sup> is washed by the river Severn
is a Large Citty—12 Churches, the streetes most of them
broad, the buildings some of them are very good and Lofty,
its Encompass’d w<sup>th</sup> a wall w<sup>ch</sup> has 4 gates that are very
strong. The Market place is Large, there is a Guildhall
besides the Market house w<sup>ch</sup> stands on pillars of stone.
The Cathedrall stands in a Large yard, pitch’d, its a Lofty
Magnificent building, the Quire has good Wood Carv’d
and a pretty organ, there is one tombstone stands in the
Middle of y<sup>e</sup> quire by the railes on which Lyes the Effigies
of King John, the Left side of alter is prince Arthurs tomb
of plaine Marble in a ffine Chappell w<sup>ch</sup> is made all of stone
ffinely Carv’d, both the Inside and the outside is very
Curiously Carv’d in all sorts of works and Arms, beasts
and flowers, under it Lyes the statues of severall Bishops,
beyond this are two tombstones w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> ffigure of y<sup>e</sup> body in
their proper dress, of 2 Saxon Bishops on y<sup>e</sup> pavement.</p>

<p class='c012'>The painting of y<sup>e</sup> Windows are good and they are
pretty Large and Lofty tho’ Nothing Comparable to the
Cathedrall at york. The tower is high and about the
Middle of it you may walke round y<sup>e</sup> Inside and Look
down into the body of y<sup>e</sup> Church just as it is in york.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Just against y<sup>e</sup> pulpit in y<sup>e</sup> body of the Church is a Little
organ to set the Psalme. Y<sup>e</sup> ffont is all of white marble
and a Carv’d Cover of wood.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Worcester we pass’d a Large stone bridge over the
Severn on w<sup>ch</sup> were many Barges that were tow’d up by
strength of men 6 or 8 at a tyme.</p>

<p class='c012'>The water just by the town Encompasses a Little piece of
Ground full of Willows and so makes it an jsland, part of
w<sup>ch</sup> turns Mills. Thence I went 4 mile where I Cross y<sup>e</sup>
River Thames on a stone Bridge, this runs to Whitborne
and is a very Rapid Streame Especially after raines, w<sup>ch</sup>
Just before we begun our Journey had fallen and made the
roads, w<sup>ch</sup> are all Lanes full of stones and up hills and down,
so steep that w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> raines y<sup>e</sup> waters stood or Else ran down
y<sup>e</sup> hills, w<sup>ch</sup> made it Exceeding bad for travelling. When
we had gone 7 mile, at a Little Parish, you Enter out of
Worcester into Herriffordshire and soe 7 mile ffarther to
Stretton Grandsorm and new house, my Cos’n Fiennes’s.
This is the worst way I ever went in Worcester or Herriffordshire,
its allwayes a deep sand and soe in the winter and w<sup>th</sup>
muck is bad way, but this being in August it was strange
and being so stony made it more Difficult to travell. From
thence I went to Stoake 4 miles, where I saw M<sup>r</sup> Folies new
house w<sup>ch</sup> was building and will be very ffine when Compleated.
There is to be 3 flat ffronts to y<sup>e</sup> Gardens sides;
the Right Wing of y<sup>e</sup> house is the severall appartments for
the ffamily, 2 drawing roomes and bed Chambers and
Closets opening both on a terrass of free stone pavements,
Each End and the middle there is stone stepps goes down
on Each side, w<sup>th</sup> half paces to the garden w<sup>ch</sup> is by more
stepps descending one below another. The other wing is to
y<sup>e</sup> other Garden and are to be Roomes of State w<sup>ch</sup> Lookes
towards Herrifford town. this is to be Coupled together
w<sup>th</sup> a Large Hall w<sup>ch</sup> Composes the ffront and is of stone
work, the rest is brick only Coyn’d w<sup>th</sup> stone and y<sup>e</sup>
windows stone, and is in forme of a halfe moone Each side
w<sup>th</sup> arches to the several offices and stables. To this ffront
w<sup>ch</sup> is to be the Entrance Large opening Iron spike gates
w<sup>ch</sup> Lookes into their Grounds and Meddowes below it, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>a Great Length w<sup>th</sup> Rows of trees to y<sup>e</sup> river. The Roofe is
Cover’d w<sup>th</sup> slatt w<sup>ch</sup> shines and very much represents Lead,
its adorn’d round y<sup>e</sup> Edges w<sup>th</sup> stone ffigures and flower
potts. There is a noble parck and woods behind—it will be
very ffine when ffinished, now I saw it only in the outside
shell and platt form. thence I returned to Newhouse 4 mile.
Thence I went to Canaan Ffroom a mile and one mile back
w<sup>ch</sup> was 2 mile more, then to Stretton four tymes and back
w<sup>ch</sup> was 8 mile, then from Newhouse to Aldbery 5 miles,
thence to Marlow 3 mile and there Entred Gloucestershire.
They are pretty long miles and in the winter deep way,
though now it was pretty good travelling its 8 mile beyond
to Glocestertown tho’ in most places near London this would
be reckon’d 20 miles; you may see the town 4 miles off.
Glocester town Lyes all along on the bancks of y<sup>e</sup> Severn
and soe Look’d Like a very huge place, being stretch’d out
in Length, its a Low Moist place therefore one must travel
on Causeys which are here in good repaire. I pass’d over a
Bridge where two armes of the river meetes where y<sup>e</sup> tyde
is very high and rowles in the sand in many places and
Causes those Whirles or Hurricanes that will Come on
storms w<sup>th</sup> great jmpetuosity.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I proceeded over another Bridge into y<sup>e</sup> town
whose streetes are very well pitch’d, Large and Cleane.
There is a faire Market place and Hall for y<sup>e</sup> assizes w<sup>ch</sup>
happened just as we Came there, soe had y<sup>e</sup> worst Entertainem<sup>t</sup>
and noe accomodation but in a private house.
Things ought not to be Deare here, but Strangers are allwayes
imposed on and at such a publick tyme alsoe they
make their advantages. Here is a very Large good Key on
the river, they are supply’d w<sup>th</sup> Coales by y<sup>e</sup> shipps and
Barges w<sup>ch</sup> makes it plentifull; they Carry it on sledges thro’
y<sup>e</sup> town—its the great Warwickshire Coale I saw unloading.
Here they follow knitting stockings, gloves wauscoates and
peticoates and sleeves all of Cotten, and others spinn the
Cottens. The Cathedrall or minster is Large, Lofty and
very neate, the Quire pretty. At y<sup>e</sup> Entrance there is a
seate over head for y<sup>e</sup> Bishop to sit in to hear the sermon
preached in y<sup>e</sup> body of y<sup>e</sup> Church, and therefore the organ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>is in the Quire on one side w<sup>ch</sup> used to be at y<sup>e</sup> Entrance.
There was a tomb stone in y<sup>e</sup> middle w<sup>th</sup> a statue of Duke
Roberts, second son to William the Conquerours son, w<sup>th</sup>
his Legs across as is the manner of all those that went to
the holy warre; this is painted and resembles marble tho’ it
is but wood and soe Light as by one ffinger you may move
it up, there is an jron Grate over it. At y<sup>e</sup> alter the painting
is soe ffine that y<sup>e</sup> tapistry and pillars and ffigure of Moses
and Aaron soe much to the Life you would at Least think
it Carv’d. There are 12 Chappells all stone finely Carv’d
on y<sup>e</sup> walls and rooffs, the windows are pretty Large and
high w<sup>th</sup> very good painting, there is a Large window just
over y<sup>e</sup> Alter but between it and y<sup>e</sup> alter is a hollow walled
in on each side w<sup>ch</sup> is a Whispering place; speake never so
Low just in the Wall at one End the person at y<sup>e</sup> other End
shall heare it plaine tho’ those w<sup>ch</sup> stand by you shall not
heare you speake—its y<sup>e</sup> Wall Carrys y<sup>e</sup> voyce. This seems
not quite soe wonderfull as I have heard, for y<sup>e</sup> Large roome
in Mountague house soe remarkable for fine painting I have
been in it, and when y<sup>e</sup> Doores are shutt its so well suited
in y<sup>e</sup> Walls you Cannot tell where to find the Doore
if a stranger, and its a Large roome Every way. I saw a
Lady stand at one Corner and turn herself to the wall and
whisper’d, y<sup>e</sup> voice Came very Cleer and plaine to y<sup>e</sup>
Company that stood at y<sup>e</sup> Crosse Corner y<sup>e</sup> roome soe y<sup>t</sup> it
Could not be Carry’d by y<sup>e</sup> side wall, it must be the arch
overhead w<sup>ch</sup> was a great height.—But to return to y<sup>e</sup>
Church, the tower was 203 stepps, the Large bell I stood
upright in but it was not so bigg as y<sup>e</sup> great Tom of
Lincoln, this bell at Glocester is raised by ten and rung by
6 men. On the tower Leads you have a prospect of y<sup>e</sup>
whole town, gardens and buildings and grounds beyond
and y<sup>e</sup> river Severn in its twistings and windings. Here are
y<sup>e</sup> fine Lamprys taken in great quantetys in their season, of
w<sup>ch</sup> they make pyes and potts and Convey them to London
or Else where, such a present being fitt for a king; this and
y<sup>e</sup> Charr fish are Equally rare and valuable. Here are very
good Cloysters finely adorn’d with ffretwork, here is the
Colledge and Library but not stored w<sup>th</sup> many books.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>I think this was all the remarkable in Glocester. From thence
I went in Company all this while w<sup>th</sup> my Cos’n Ffilmer and
family. We Came to Nymphsffield after having ascended
a very steep narrow and stony hill, 10 mile to Nympsfield
all bad way, but the 20 mile afterwards made up for its
badness, for these were Exceeding good wayes. 2 mile to
Cold harbour thence 15 Landsdon—Long, but bowling green
way. Here I passed by Babington, the Duke of Beaufforts
house stands in a Parke on an advanc’d Ground w<sup>th</sup> rows of
trees on all sides w<sup>ch</sup> runns a good Length, and you may
stand on y<sup>e</sup> Leads and Look 12 wayes down to y<sup>e</sup> parishes
and Grounds beyond all thro Glides or visto of trees. The
Gardens are very fine and water works. On Landsdon hill
Summersetshire begins w<sup>ch</sup> is a very pleasant hill for to
Ride on for aire and prospect; I went 3 mile over it w<sup>ch</sup>
Leads to y<sup>e</sup> Bath down a vast steep descent of a stony
narrow way as is all y<sup>e</sup> wayes down into y<sup>e</sup> town. The
Bath is a pretty place full of good houses all for y<sup>e</sup> accomodation
of the Company that resort thither to Drink or Bathe
in the summer. The streetes are faire and well pitch’d, they
Carry most things on sledges, and y<sup>e</sup> Company all y<sup>e</sup>
morning y<sup>e</sup> Chaires of Bayes to Carry them to the Bath—soe
they have the Chaire or Sedan to Carry them in visits.
There is a very fine hall w<sup>ch</sup> is set on stone pillars w<sup>ch</sup> they
use for y<sup>e</sup> balls and dancing. This is the only new thing
since I was at y<sup>e</sup> Bath before, Except the fine adornements
on y<sup>e</sup> Cross in the Cross bath, fine Carving of stone w<sup>th</sup> the
English arms and Saints and Cupids, according to the
phaneze and Religion of King James the Seconds Queen
Mary of Modina, as part of her thanks and acknowledgments
to y<sup>e</sup> saints or Virgin Mary for the Welsh Prince she
Imposed on us. From the Bath I went westward to Bristol
over Landsdown 10 mile, and passed thro’ Kingswood and
was met w<sup>th</sup> a great many horses passing and returning
Loaden w<sup>th</sup> Coales Dug just thereabout; they give 12 pence
a horse Load w<sup>ch</sup> Carrys two Bushells, it makes very good
ffires, this is y<sup>e</sup> Cakeing Coale. Bristol Lyes Low in a
bottom the Greatest part of the town, tho’ one End of it
you have a pretty rise of ground.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span> There are 19 Parish Churches beside the Cathedrall, w<sup>ch</sup>
has nothing fine or Curious in it. The Buildings of y<sup>e</sup> town
are pretty high, most of timber work, the streetes are narrow
and something Darkish because the roomes on y<sup>e</sup> upper
storys are more jutting out, soe Contracts y<sup>e</sup> streete and the
Light. The Suburbs are better buildings and more spacious
streetes. There are at one place as you Enter the town 2
almshouses, 6 men and 6 women a piece at Each. There is
alsoe at another part of y<sup>e</sup> town a Noble almshouse more
Like a Gentlemans house, y<sup>t</sup> is all of stone work, a handsome
Court w<sup>th</sup> gates and Pallisadoes before four grass plotts
divided by paved walks and a walk round y<sup>e</sup> same. The
one side is for y<sup>e</sup> women the other for y<sup>e</sup> men, the middle
building is 2 Kitchins for Either and a middle roome in
Common for washing and brewing, over all is a Chappell.
They have Gardens behind it w<sup>th</sup> all things Convenient.
They have their Coales and 3 shillings p<sup>r</sup> weeke allowed
to Each to maintain them, this is for decayed tradesmen
and wives that have Lived well; its set up and allowed to
by M<sup>r</sup> Coleson a merch<sup>t</sup> in London. This town is a very
great tradeing Citty as most In England, and is Esteemed
the Largest next London. The river Aven y<sup>t</sup> is flowed up
by the sea into y<sup>e</sup> Severn and soe up the Aven to the town,
Beares shipps and Barges up to the Key, where I saw y<sup>e</sup>
harbour was full of shipps carrying Coales and all sorts of
Commodityes to other parts. The bridge is built over w<sup>th</sup>
houses just as London bridge is, but its not so bigg or
Long—there are 4 arches here. They have Little boates
w<sup>ch</sup> are Call’d Wherryes such as we use on the Thames, soe
they use them here to Convey persons from place to place,
and in many places there are signes to many houses that
are not Publick houses just as it is in London, the streetes
are well pitch’d, and preserved by their useing sleds to
Carry all things about. There is a very faire market place
and an Exchange set on stone Pillars. In another place
there is a very high and magnificent Cross built all of y<sup>e</sup>
stone or sort of Marble of y<sup>e</sup> Country, its in the manner of
Coventry Cross a Piramedy fform running up of a great
height, w<sup>th</sup> severall divisions in nitches where is King Johns
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>Effigy and severall other, adorned w<sup>th</sup> armes and figures of
Beasts and birds and flowers. Great part of it Gilt and
painted and soe terminates in a spire on y<sup>e</sup> top, the Lower
part is white Like Marble. Just by the water side is a
Long rope yard w<sup>ch</sup> is Encompass’d w<sup>th</sup> trees on Either
side w<sup>ch</sup> are Lofty and shady, therefore its made Choice of
for y<sup>e</sup> Company of y<sup>e</sup> town to take y<sup>e</sup> Diversion of walking
in the Evening. This Compasses round a Large space of
ground w<sup>ch</sup> is Called y<sup>e</sup> marsh—a green ground. There
was noe remaines of the Castle. There are 12 gates to y<sup>e</sup>
Citty, there is a very Large Conduit by y<sup>e</sup> Key finely
Carv’d, all stone, this Conveys the water about y<sup>e</sup> town but
all y<sup>e</sup> water has a Brackish taste. There is one Church w<sup>ch</sup>
is an Entire worke all of stone, noe timbers but ye Rafters
and beames belonging to y<sup>e</sup> Roofe and y<sup>e</sup> seates they sit in.
Y<sup>e</sup> Leads are very high and Large and very neate kept,
the tower 15 stepps upon w<sup>ch</sup> the whole Citty is discover’d,
w<sup>ch</sup> by reason of the good gardens and grounds within its
walls is a very Large tract of ground in y<sup>e</sup> whole. There
you see the Colledge green in w<sup>ch</sup> stands the Cathedrall and
y<sup>e</sup> Doctors houses, w<sup>ch</sup> are not very fine, built of stone.
There are some few monuments in this Church w<sup>th</sup> good
Carvings of stone round y<sup>e</sup> tombs and some Effigies, there
are 8 bells in this Church, there is 2 men goes to y<sup>e</sup> ringing
y<sup>e</sup> biggest bell. From thence I went 2 miles to y<sup>e</sup> hott
spring of water w<sup>ch</sup> Lookes Exceeding Cleer and is as
warm as new milk and much of that sweetness. This
is just by S<sup>t</sup> Vincents Rocks y<sup>t</sup> are Great Clifts w<sup>ch</sup>
seeme as bounds to y<sup>e</sup> river Aven, this Channell was hewn
out of those Rocks. They Digg y<sup>e</sup> Bristol Diamonds w<sup>ch</sup>
Look very Bright and sparkling and in their native Rudeness
have a great Lustre and are pointed and Like y<sup>e</sup>
Diamond Cutting; I had a piece just as it Came out of y<sup>e</sup>
Rock w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Rock on y<sup>e</sup> back side and it appeared to me as
a Cluster of Diamonds polish’d and jrregularly Cut. Some
of these are hard and will Endure the Cutting and
pollishing by art and soe they make rings and Earings of
them, the harder the stone is more valuable, w<sup>ch</sup> differences
y<sup>e</sup> true Diamond that will bear the fire or y<sup>e</sup> greatest force,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>and Cannot be divided nor Cut but by some of itself,
diamond dust being y<sup>e</sup> only way they Can Cut diamonds
that itself is Capable of Impressing Carracters on Glass.
Here I fferry’d over the Avon that Comes up to y<sup>e</sup> town w<sup>th</sup>
a Great tyde in two parts; about 6 mile off it joyns y<sup>e</sup>
Severn w<sup>ch</sup> now begins to swell into a vast river of 7 mile
over before it Enters the sea. Then I went to Aston a
mile from y<sup>e</sup> water side thro’ a fine park, an old Large
house, and thence I passed over Large downs and saw 2
other good houses built of stone, w<sup>th</sup> towers on y<sup>e</sup> top, and
severall Rows of trees Leading to them which made them
appear very fine. Soe to Oakey Hole w<sup>ch</sup> from y<sup>e</sup> water
side where I ferry’d is Esteemed but 15 long mile, its y<sup>e</sup>
same Distance from Bristole but I would not goe back to
y<sup>e</sup> town, but twere better I had, for I made it at Least 17
mile that way. Oakey Hole is a Large Cavity under
ground Like Poole Hole in Darbyshire, only this seemes to
be a great hill above it. Its full of great Rocks and stones
Lying in it just as if they were hewen out of a quarry and
Laid down all in y<sup>e</sup> ground, y<sup>e</sup> wall and Roofe is all a
Rocky stone, there is a Lofty space they Call the hall and
another y<sup>e</sup> parlour, and another the Kitchen, the Entrance
of Each one out of another is w<sup>th</sup> greate stooping under
Rocks y<sup>t</sup> hang down almost to touch y<sup>e</sup> ground, beyond
this is a Cistern allwayes full of water, it Looks Cleer to
the bottom w<sup>ch</sup> is all full of stones as is the sides, just Like
Candy or Like the Branches they put in the boyling of
Copperace for y<sup>e</sup> Copperice to Crust about it, in the same
manner so y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> water Congeales here into stone and does
as it were bud or grow out one stone out of another.
Where Ever this water drops it does not weare y<sup>e</sup> Rock in
hollow as some other such subterranian Caves does but it
hardens and does Encrease y<sup>e</sup> stone and that in a Roundness
as if it Candy’d as it fell, w<sup>ch</sup> I am of opinion it does;
so it makes y<sup>e</sup> Rocks grow and meete Each other in some
places.</p>

<p class='c012'>They ffancy many Resemblances in the Rocks, as in one
place an organ and in another 2 little Babys and in another
part a head w<sup>ch</sup> they Call the porters head and another a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>shape like a dog. They phancy one of y<sup>e</sup> Rocks resembles
a woman w<sup>th</sup> a great belly w<sup>ch</sup> the Country people Call the
witch w<sup>ch</sup> made this Cavity under ground for her Enchantments.
The rocks are Glistering and shine Like diamonds
and some you Climbe over where one meetes w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
Congealed Drops of water just Like jceicles hanging down.
Some of the stone is white Like alabaster and Glisters Like
mettle. You walke for y<sup>e</sup> most part in y<sup>e</sup> Large spaces
Called y<sup>e</sup> Roomes on a sandy floore, the Roofe so Lofty
one Can scarce discern the top and Carry’s a Great Eccho,
soe that takeing up a great stone as much as a man Can
heave up to his head and letting it fall gives a report Like
a Cannon w<sup>ch</sup> they frequently trye and Call y<sup>e</sup> Shooteing
y<sup>e</sup> Cannons. At y<sup>e</sup> farther End you Come to a water
Call’d y<sup>e</sup> well, its of a greate depth and Compass tho’ by
the Light of y<sup>e</sup> Candles you may discern the Rock Encompassing
it as a wall round. These hollows are generally
very Cold and damp by reason of y<sup>e</sup> waters distilling
Continually w<sup>ch</sup> is very Cold, as jce almost when I put my
hand into y<sup>e</sup> Cistern. These Roads are full of hills, and
those some of them high Ridge of hills w<sup>ch</sup> does discover a
vast prospect all wayes, behind me I saw a Great valley
full of jnclosures and Lessar hills by which you ascend
these heights, w<sup>ch</sup> are all very fruitfull and woody. Alsoe I
Could see the Severn when Encreased to its breadth of 7
mile over, and there it Disembogues into ye sea; then it
gave me a prospect forward of as Large a vale replenish’d
w<sup>th</sup> fruitefull hills and trees and good Ground, thence I
Could discern Glassenbury tower; this was Maiden Hill
just beyond ye Little town of same name and soe by
degrees descending from a higher to a Lower hill w<sup>ch</sup> had
its ascents as well as its descents w<sup>ch</sup> makes y<sup>e</sup> miles seem
and are Indeed Long tracts of ground.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Ocley Hole I went to Wells w<sup>ch</sup> was on an Even
ground one mile farther, this Wells is what must be
Reckoned halfe a Citty this and y<sup>e</sup> Bath makeing up but
one Bishops See. Here are two Churches w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall.
Y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall has y<sup>e</sup> greatest Curiosity for Carv’d work in
stone, the West front is full of all sorts of ffigures, y<sup>e</sup> 12
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>apostles, y<sup>e</sup> K and Q w<sup>th</sup> angells and figures of all forms,
as thick one to another as Can be, and soe almost all
round y<sup>e</sup> Church.</p>

<p class='c012'>The assizes was in the town w<sup>ch</sup> filled it Like a faire, and
Little stands for selling things was in all the streetes.
There I saw y<sup>e</sup> town hall. The streetes are well pitch’d,
and a Large market place and shambles. The Bishops
pallace is in a park moated round, nothing worth notice in
it. S<sup>t</sup> Andrews well w<sup>ch</sup> gives name to the town Bubbles
up so quick a spring and becomes the head of two Little
rivers w<sup>ch</sup> Encreases a Little way off into good rivers.
Thence I went to Glasenbury 4 miles, a pretty Levell way
till just you Come to the town, then I ascended a stony
hill and went just by the tower w<sup>ch</sup> is on a green Round
riseing ground. There is only a Little tower remaines
Like a Beacon, it had Bells formerly in it and some superstition
observ’d there, but now its broken down on one side.
From this I descended a very steep stony way into the
town; Glasenbury tho’ in ancient tymes was a Renowned
place where was founded the first monastery, its now a
Ragged poor place and the abbey has only the Kitchen
remaining in it w<sup>ch</sup> is a distinct Building, round like a
pigeon house all stone. The walls of y<sup>e</sup> abbey here and
there appeares and some Little places and y<sup>e</sup> Cellar or
vault w<sup>ch</sup> if they Cast a stone into the place it gives a great
Echo, and y<sup>e</sup> Country people says its y<sup>e</sup> Devil set there on
a tun of money w<sup>ch</sup> makes y<sup>e</sup> noise Least they should take
it away from him. There is the holly thorn growing on a
Chimney, this the superstitious Covet much and have gott
some of it for their gardens and soe have almost quite
spoiled it, w<sup>ch</sup> did grow quite round a Chimney tunnell
in the stone. Here is a very pretty Church a good tower
well Carv’d all stone 160 stepps up. Walking in the tower
I Could have a prospect of the whole place w<sup>ch</sup> appeared
very Ragged and decayed. The Church is neate, there is
the Effigee of the abbot on a tombstone Carved all about
w<sup>th</sup> Eschuteons of a Camell, and round it an jnscription
or motto in old Latin and an old Caracter. It was a
phancy of his Stewards who was a very faithfull Dilligent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>servant, and as he made use of those Creatures in his
masters service y<sup>t</sup> were strong and Industrious so y<sup>e</sup> motto
described his services under that resemblance. The Effigee
was very Curious and w<sup>th</sup> rings on the fingers, but in Monmouths
tyme the soldiers defaced it much.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence to Taunton 16 miles through many small
places and scattering houses, through Lanes full of stones
and by the Great raines just before full of wet and Dirt. I
passed over a Large Common or bottom of Deep black
Land which is bad for the Rider but good for the abider as
the proverb is; this was 2 or 3 mile long and pass’d and
repass’d a river as it twin’d about at Least ten tymes over
stone bridges. This river Comes from Bridge water 7 mile,
the tyde Comes up beyond Bridge water, Even within 3
mile of Taunton its flowed by the tyde w<sup>ch</sup> brings up the
Barges w<sup>th</sup> Coale to this place, after having pass’d a Large
Common w<sup>ch</sup> on Either hand Leads a great waye, good rich
Land w<sup>th</sup> ditches and willow trees all for feeding Cattle, and
here at this Little place where the boates unlade the Coale
y<sup>e</sup> packhorses Comes and takes it in sacks and so Carryes
it to y<sup>e</sup> places all about. This is y<sup>e</sup> sea Coale brought from
Bristole, the horses Carry 2 Bushell at a tyme w<sup>ch</sup> at the
place Cost 18<sup>d</sup> and when its brought to Taunton Cost 2
shillings. The roads were full of these Carryers going and
returning.</p>

<p class='c012'>Taunton is a Large town haveing houses of all sorts of
buildings both brick and stone, but mostly timber and
plaister, its a very neate place and Looks substantial as a
place of good trade. You meete all sorts of Country
women wrapp’d up in the mantles Called West Country
rockets, a Large mantle doubled together of a sort of serge,
some are Linsywolsey and a deep fringe or ffag at the
Lower End, these hang down some to their feete some only
just below y<sup>e</sup> wast, in the summer they are all in white
garments of this sort, in the winter they are in Red ones. I
Call them garments because they never go out w<sup>th</sup> out them
and this is the universal ffashion in Sommerset and Devonshire
and Cornwall. Here is a good Market Cross well
Carv’d and a Large Market house on Pillars for the Corn.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>I was in the Largest Church, it was mending, it was pretty
Large, the alter stood table wayes in the middle of the
Chancell, there was one good stone Statue stood in the wall,
the Effigee was very tall in a Ruff and Long Black dress
Like some Religious w<sup>th</sup> his Gloves and book in his hand.
There were severall Little monuments with Inscriptions
Round them, they have Encompass’d the Church yard
with a new Brick wall and handsom Iron gates, there
is a Large space Called the Castle yard and some remaines
of the Castle walls and Buildings w<sup>ch</sup> is fitted up for
a good dwelling house. From thence I went to Wellington,
they Call it but 5 mile but its a Long 7 tho’
the way was pretty good; this is a Little Market town.
Thence to Culimton 13 mile more, but Indeed these were
very long Miles, y<sup>e</sup> hostler at Tanton did say tho’ they were
reckon’d but 16 miles it really was a good 20 miles and I
am much of that mind. I mostly pass’d through Lanes, I
entred Into Devonshire 5 mile off from Wellington, just on
a high ridge of hills w<sup>ch</sup> discovers a vast prospect on Each
side full of Inclosures and Lesser hills w<sup>ch</sup> is the Description
of most part of the West. You Could see Large tracts of
grounds full of Enclosures good Grass and Corn beset with
quicksetts and hedge rows, and these Lesser hills w<sup>ch</sup> are
scarce perceivable on y<sup>e</sup> Ridge of the uppermost, yet the
Least of them have a steep ascent and descent to pass them.
Culimton is a good Little market town, and market Cross
and another set on stone pillars, such a one was at Wellington
but on Brick work pillars. Here was a Large meeteing
of neer 4 or 500 people, they have a very good minister but
a young man, I was glad to see soe many tho’ they were
but of the meaner sort, for Indeed its the poor Receive the
Gospell and there are in most of the market towns in the
West very good meeteings. This Little place was one
Continued Long streete but few houses y<sup>t</sup> struck out of the
streete. From thence 10 mile to Exetter, up hills and
down as before, till one attaines those uppermost Ridges of
all w<sup>ch</sup> discovers the whole valley, then you sometymes goe
a mile or two on a Down till the Brow of the hill begins in
a Descent on the other side. This Citty appears to view 2
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>mile distant from one of those heights, and also the River
Ex w<sup>ch</sup> runs to Topshum where y<sup>e</sup> shipps Comes up to the
Barre; this is 7 mile by water from w<sup>ch</sup> they are attempting
to make navigeable to the town, which will be of Mighty
advantage to have shipps Come up Close to the town to
take in their Serges w<sup>ch</sup> now they are forced to send to
Topshum on horses by Land, w<sup>ch</sup> is about 4 mile by Land.
They had just agreed w<sup>th</sup> a man that was to accomplish
this work for w<sup>ch</sup> they were to give 5 or 6000<sup>£</sup>, who had made
a beginning on it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Exeter is a town very well built, the streets are well
pitch’d, spacious noble streetes, and a vast trade is Carryed
on, as Norwitch is for Coapes Callamanco and damaske, soe
this is for serges. There is an Increadible quantety of them
made and sold in the town. There market day is Fryday
which supplys with all things Like a faire almost; the
markets for meate, fowle, ffish, garden things and the Dairy
produce takes up 3 whole streetes besides the Large Market
house set on stone pillars, w<sup>ch</sup> runs a great Length on w<sup>ch</sup>
they Lay their packs of serges. Just by it is another walke
w<sup>th</sup> in pillars w<sup>ch</sup> is for the yarne, the whole town and
Country is Employ’d for at Least 20 mile round in spinning,
weaveing, dressing and scouring, fulling and Drying of the
serges. It turns the most money in a weeke of any thing in
England. One weeke with another there is 10000 pound
paid in ready money, Sometymes 15000 pound. The
weavers brings in their serges and must have their money
w<sup>ch</sup> they Employ to provide them yarne to goe to work
againe. There is alsoe a square Court with Penthouses
round where the Malters are w<sup>th</sup> Mault and oat meal, but
the serge is the Chief manufacture. There is a prodigious
quantety of their serges they never bring into the market
but are in hired roomes w<sup>ch</sup> are noted for it, for it would be
impossible to have it altogether. The Carryers I met going
w<sup>th</sup> it, as thick, all Entring into town w<sup>th</sup> their Loaded
horses, they bring them all just from the Loome and soe
they are put into the ffulling-mills, but first they will Clean
and Scour their roomes with them, w<sup>ch</sup> by the way gives noe
pleasing perfume to a roome, the oyle and grease, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>should think it would Rather foull a roome than Cleanse it
because of the oyles, but I perceive its otherwise Esteemed
by them w<sup>ch</sup> will send to their acquaintances y<sup>t</sup> are tuckers
the dayes the serges Comes in for a Rowle to Clean their
house—this I was an Eye witness of. Then they Lay them
in soack in vrine, then they soape them and soe put them
into the ffulling-mills and soe worke them in the mills drye
till they are thick enough then they turne water into them
and so scower them. Y<sup>e</sup> mill does draw out and gather in
y<sup>e</sup> serges, its a pretty divertion to see it, a sort of huge
notch’d timbers Like great teethe;—one would thinke it
should Injure the serges but it does not. Y<sup>e</sup> mills draws in
w<sup>th</sup> such a great violence that if one stands neere it and it
Catch a bitt of your Garments it would be ready to draw in
y<sup>e</sup> person even in a trice. When they are thus scour’d they
drye them in racks strained out w<sup>ch</sup> are as thick set one by
another as will permitt y<sup>e</sup> dresses to pass between, and huge
Large fields occupy’d this way almost all round the town
w<sup>ch</sup> is to the river side; then when drye they pick out all
knots then fold them w<sup>th</sup> a paper between Every fold and
so sett them on an jron plaite and screw down y<sup>e</sup> press on
them w<sup>ch</sup> has another jron plaite on the top under w<sup>ch</sup> is a
furnace of fire of Coales, this is the hott press; then they fold
them Exceeding Exact and then press them in a Cold press,
some they dye but the most are sent up for London white.</p>

<p class='c012'>I saw the severall ffatts they were a Dying in of black,
yellow, blew and Green w<sup>ch</sup> two Last Coullours are dipp’d
in the same fatt, that w<sup>ch</sup> makes it differ is what they were
dipp’d in before w<sup>ch</sup> makes them Either green or blew;
they hang the Serges on a great beame or Great pole on the
top of y<sup>e</sup> fatt and so keep turning it from one to another—as
one turns it off into the ffatt y<sup>e</sup> other Rowles it out of it,
soe they do it backwards and forwards till its tinged deep
Enough of the Coullour. Their ffurnace that keepes their
dye panns boyling is all under that roome made of Coale
ffires. There was in a roome by itself a ffatt for the Scarlet
that being a very Changeable dye noe waste must be
allow’d in that, Indeed I think they make as fine a Coullour
as their bowdies are in London.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span> These Rolers I spake of two men does Continually role on
and off y<sup>e</sup> pieces of serge till Dipp’d Enough, the length of
these pieces are or should hold out 26 yards. This Citty
does Exceedingly resemble London for besides these
buildings I mention’d for y<sup>e</sup> severall Markets, there is an
Exchange full of shopps Like our Exchanges are, only its
but one walke along as was the Exchange at Salisbury
house in the Strand; there is also a very Large space
Railed in just by the Cathedrall with walks round it w<sup>ch</sup> is
Called the Exchange for Merchants, that Constantly meete
twice a day just as they do in London. There are 17
Churches in the Citty and 4 in the subburbs, there is some
remaines of the Castle walls, they make use of the roomes
w<sup>ch</sup> are inside for y<sup>e</sup> assizes, there is the two Barrs besides
being Large rooms w<sup>th</sup> seates and places Convenient and
jury roome, here is a Large walke at y<sup>e</sup> Entrance between
Rowes of Pillars, there is besides this just at y<sup>e</sup> market
place a Guild hall the Entrance of w<sup>ch</sup> is a Large place set
on stone Pillars, beyond w<sup>ch</sup> are y<sup>e</sup> roomes for the session
or any town affaires to be adjusted. Behind this building
there is a vast Cistern w<sup>ch</sup> holds upwards of 600 hodsheads
of water which supplyes by pipes the whole Citty; this
Cistern is replenished from the river w<sup>ch</sup> is on purpose
turned into a Little Channell by it self to turn the mill, and
ffills the Engine that Casts y<sup>e</sup> water into the truncks w<sup>ch</sup>
Conveys it to this Cistern. The water Engine is Like
those at Islington and at Darby as I have seen, and is
what now they make use of in Diverse places Either to
supply them w<sup>th</sup> water or to draine a marsh or overplus of
water. The river X is a fine streame, they have made
severall bayes or wires above the Bridge w<sup>ch</sup> Casts y<sup>e</sup> water
into many Channells for the Conveniencys of turning all
their mills, by w<sup>ch</sup> meanes they have Composed a Little
jsland, for at the End it againe returns into its own united
Channell. Those wires makes great falls into y<sup>e</sup> water, it
Comes w<sup>th</sup> great violence; here they Catch the Salmon as
they Leap w<sup>th</sup> speares, the first of these Bayes is a very
great one, there is one below the bridge w<sup>ch</sup> must be taken
away when the navigation is Compleate for they will need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>all their water together to fill it to a Depth to Carry the
shipps for just by the Bridge is the Key design’d, or y<sup>t</sup> w<sup>ch</sup>
now is already they will Enlarge to that place. Just by
this key is the Custome house, an open space below w<sup>th</sup>
rows of pillars w<sup>ch</sup> they Lay in goods just as its unladen
out of the shipps in Case of wet. Just by are Severall
Little roomes for Land waiters &amp;c, then you ascend up a
handsome pair of staires into a Large roome full of Desks
and Little partitions for the writers and accountants, it was
full of books and files of paper. By it are two other
Roomes w<sup>ch</sup> are used in the same way when there is a
great deale of Bussiness. There are severall good Conduites
to Supply y<sup>e</sup> Citty w<sup>th</sup> water besides that Cistern,
there is alsoe a very fine market Cross.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Cathedrall at Exetter is preserv’d in its outside
adornments beyond most I have seen, there remaining
more of y<sup>e</sup> fine Carv’d worke in stone, the ffigures and
nitches full and in proportion, tho’ Indeed I Cannot say it
has that great Curiosity of work and variety as the great
Church at Wells. Its a Lofty building in y<sup>e</sup> Inside, the
Largest pair of organs<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c028'><sup>[1]</sup></a> I have Ever seen w<sup>th</sup> fine Carving
of wood w<sup>ch</sup> runs up a Great height, and made a magnificent
appearance. The Quire is very neate, but y<sup>e</sup> Bishops seate
or throne was Exceeding and very high and y<sup>e</sup> Carving very
fine and took up a Great Compass full of all variety of
ffigures, something Like the worke over y<sup>e</sup> arch Bishops
throne in S<sup>t</sup> Pauls, London, but this was Larger if not so
Curious. There was severall good monuments and Effigies
of Bishops; there was one of a judge and his Lady that
was very Curious, their Garments Embroyder’d all marble
and Gilt and painted. There was a very Large good
Library in w<sup>ch</sup> was a press that had an anatomy of a
woman. Y<sup>e</sup> tower is 167 steps up on which I had a view of
y<sup>e</sup> whole town w<sup>ch</sup> is Generally well built. I saw y<sup>e</sup> Bishops
pallace and Garden, there is a long walke as well as broad,
Enclosed w<sup>th</sup> rows of Lofty trees which made it shady and
very pleasant, w<sup>ch</sup> went along by the Ditch and banck on w<sup>ch</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>the town wall stands. There are 5 gates to y<sup>e</sup> town, there
is alsoe another Long walke within shady trees on y<sup>e</sup> other
side of the town, w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to the Grounds where the drying
frames are set up for the serges.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom thence I pass’d the Bridge aCross the River Ex
to Chedly w<sup>ch</sup> was 9 mile, mostly Lanes and a Continual
going up hill and down, some of them pretty steep hills and
all these Lesser hills as I have observ’d rises higher and
higher till it advances you upon the high Ridge w<sup>ch</sup>
discovers to view the Great valleys below full of those
Lesser hills and jnclosures w<sup>th</sup> quicksett hedges and trees
and Rich Land, but the Roads are not to be seen being all
along in Lanes Cover’d over with y<sup>e</sup> shelter of the hedges
and trees. Then when I was on y<sup>e</sup> top hill I went 3 or 4
miles on an open down w<sup>ch</sup> brought me to the Edge of
another such a Ridge, w<sup>ch</sup> was by some steps to be
descended as it was gained by y<sup>e</sup> Lesser hills one below
another till I Came to y<sup>e</sup> bottom, and then I had about 2 or
3 mile along on a plaine or Common w<sup>ch</sup> for the most part
are a Little moorish by reason of their receiving the water
that draines from the severall Great hills on Either side,
and so then I am to rise up another such a Range of hills,
and as neer as I Could Compute in my Rideing it was 6 or
7 miles between one high Ridge of hills to that over against
it, whereas were there a Bridge over from one top to the
other it Could not be 2 mile distant; but this does give
them y<sup>e</sup> advantage of severall acres of Land by reason of
the many hills w<sup>ch</sup> if drawn out on plaines as in some other
parts would appear much vaster tracts of Land. On these
hills as I said one Can discern Little besides inclosures
hedges and trees, rarely Can see houses unless you are just
descending to them, they allwayes are placed in holes as it
were and you have a precipice to go down to Come at
them. Y<sup>e</sup> Lanes are full of stones and dirt for y<sup>e</sup> most part
because they are so Close the sun and wind Cannot Come
at them, soe that in many places you travell on Causeys
w<sup>ch</sup> are uneven also for want of a Continued repaire.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Chedly to Ashburton is 11 mile more, in all 20
mile from Exeter, the Roads being much the same as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>before. This Ashburton is a poor Little town—bad was
the best Inn. Its a market town and here are a Great
many descenters and those of the most Considerable
persons in the town; there was a presbiterian, an anabaptist,
and quakers meeteing. Thence I went for
Plymouth 24 long miles, and here the Roades Contract and
y<sup>e</sup> Lanes are exceeding narrow and so Cover’d up you Can
see Little about; an army Might be marching undiscover’d
by any body, for when you are on those heights that shews
a vast Country about you Cannot see one Road. The
wayes now become so difficult y<sup>t</sup> one Could scarcely pass
by Each other, Even y<sup>e</sup> single horses, and so Dirty in many
places, and just a track for one horses feete, and the Banks
on Either side so neer, and were they not well secured and
mended w<sup>th</sup> stones stuck Close Like a Drye wall Everywhere
when they discover the Bancks to Breake and molder
down, which Else would be in Danger of swallowing up the
way quite; for on these bancks (w<sup>ch</sup> are some of them
naturall Rocks and quarrys, others mended w<sup>th</sup> such stone
or slate stuck Edgewayes to secure them) for the quicksetts
and trees that grow on these Bancks Loosen the mold and
so makes it molder downe sometymes. I pass’d through
severall Little places and over some stone Bridges. Y<sup>e</sup>
waters are pretty broad soe these are 4 or 5 arches most
Bridges, all stone. The running of y<sup>e</sup> waters is w<sup>th</sup> a huge
Rushing by reason of y<sup>e</sup> stones w<sup>ch</sup> Lye in the water, some
of them Great rocks w<sup>ch</sup> gives some Interruption to y<sup>e</sup>
Current w<sup>ch</sup> finding another way Either by its sides or
mounting over part of it Causes y<sup>e</sup> frothing of y<sup>e</sup> water and
y<sup>e</sup> noise—the rivers being full of stones bigger or Less.
About 4 or 5 mile from ashburton I Came to a Little place
Called Dean and at y<sup>e</sup> End of it ascended a very steep hill,
all rock almost; and so it was Like so many steps up, this
is Called Dean Clapperhill, it was an untoward place but
not soe fformidable to me as the people of y<sup>e</sup> place where I
Lay described it, haveing gone much worse hills in the North.
All along on the road where the Lanes are a Little broader
you ride by rowes of trees on Each side, set and kept
Exactly Even and Cut, y<sup>e</sup> tops being for shade and beauty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>and they in exact forme as if a Grove to some house. At
first I thought it was neer some houses till the frequency
and Length proved the Contrary, for there are very few if
any houses neare the Road, unless the Little villages you
passe through. This Country being almost full of stone
the streetes and roades too have a naturall sort of paveing
or Pitching tho’ uneven. All their Carriages are here on y<sup>e</sup>
Backs of horses, w<sup>th</sup> sort of hookes Like yoakes stands upon
Each side of a good height, w<sup>ch</sup> are the Receptacles of
their goods Either wood, ffurse or Lime or Coale or Corn
or hay or straw or what Else they Convey from place to
place, and I Cannot see how two such horses Can pass Each
other or Indeed in some places how any horse Can pass by
Each other, and yet these are the roads y<sup>t</sup> are all here
abouts. Some Little Corners may jutt out that one may a
Little get out of y<sup>e</sup> way of Each other, but this but seldom.
Two mile from Plymouth we Come to y<sup>e</sup> river Plym just
by a Little town all built of stone and y<sup>e</sup> tyleing is all flatt
w<sup>ch</sup> with y<sup>e</sup> Lime its Cemented, w<sup>ch</sup> makes it Look white
Like snow, and in the sun shineing on the slatt it Glisters.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here I Came in sight on y<sup>e</sup> Right hand of a very Large
house built all with this sort of stone w<sup>ch</sup> is a sort of
marble. Even all quaryes are, and some ffine marble.
This house Look’d very finely in a thicket of trees Like
a Grove and was on the side of a hill and Led just down to
the head of y<sup>e</sup> river Plym w<sup>ch</sup> is fill’d with y<sup>e</sup> tyde from the
sea, and here I Cross’d it on a stone bridge. Soe I Rode 2
miles mostly by the river w<sup>ch</sup> encreases and is a fine broad
streame and at y<sup>e</sup> town w<sup>ch</sup> is its mouth it falls into the sea.
The sea here runs into severall Creekes, one place it runs
up to y<sup>e</sup> Dock and Milbrook, another arm of y<sup>e</sup> sea goes up
to Saltash and Port Eliot.</p>

<p class='c012'>Plymouth is 2 Parishes Called y<sup>e</sup> old town and y<sup>e</sup> new,
the houses all built of this marble and y<sup>e</sup> Slatt at the top
Lookes Like Lead and glisters in the sun. There are noe
great houses in the town, the streetes are good and Clean,
there is a great many tho’ some are but narrow, they are
mostly inhabitted w<sup>th</sup> seamen and those w<sup>ch</sup> have affaires on
y<sup>e</sup> sea, for here up to the town there is a Depth of water for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>shipps of y<sup>e</sup> first Rate to Ride. Its Great sea and Dangerous
by reason of y<sup>e</sup> severall poynts of Land between w<sup>ch</sup> the sea
runs up a Great way, and there are severall Little jslands
alsoe all w<sup>ch</sup> beares the severall tydes hard one against y<sup>e</sup>
other. There are two keyes, the one is a broad space w<sup>ch</sup>
Leads you up into the broad streete and is used in manner
of an exchange for the merchants meeteing, for in this
streete alsoe is a fine stone Crosse and alsoe a long market
house set on stone Pillars. There are severall good Cunduits
to Convey the water to the town w<sup>ch</sup> Conveyance y<sup>e</sup> famous
S<sup>r</sup> Ffrancis Drake (w<sup>ch</sup> did encompass y<sup>e</sup> world in Queen
Elizabeths dayes and Landed safe at Plymouth) he gave
this to y<sup>e</sup> town. There are two Churches in the town but
nothing fine. I was in y<sup>e</sup> best and saw only King Charles
the firsts Picture at Length at prayer just as its Cut on the
frontispiece of the jnenicum. This picture was Drawn and
given the Church when he was in his troubles, for some
piece of service shewn him. The alter stands in the Chancell
or Railed place, but it stands table wise the Length and not
up against the wall. The ffont was of marble and Indeed
soe is all buildings here for their stone is all a sort of Marble,
some Coarser some finer. There are 4 Large meetings for
the descenters in the town takeing in the Quakers and
anabaptists.</p>

<p class='c012'>The mouth of y<sup>e</sup> river just at y<sup>e</sup> town is a very good
Harbour for Shipps, the Dockyards are about 2 mile from
the town—by boate you goe to it y<sup>e</sup> nearest way—its
one of y<sup>e</sup> best in England. A Great many good shipps
built there, and the Great Depth of water w<sup>ch</sup> Comes
up to it tho’ it runs for 2 mile between y<sup>e</sup> Land, w<sup>ch</sup>
also shelters y<sup>e</sup> shipps. There is a great deale of Buildings
on the Dock, a very good house for the Masters
and severall Lesser ones, and house for their Cordage
and makeing Ropes, and all sorts of things required in
building or Refitting ships, it Lookes Like a Little town.
The Buildings are so many and all of marble w<sup>th</sup> ffine slate
on y<sup>e</sup> Rooffs and at a Little Distance it makes all the houses
shew as if they were Cover’d w<sup>th</sup> snow and Glisters in y<sup>e</sup>
sunn w<sup>ch</sup> adds to their beauty. Y<sup>e</sup> ffine and only thing in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Plymouth town is the Cittadell or Castle w<sup>ch</sup> stands very
high above the town, the walls and battlements round it w<sup>th</sup>
all their Works and Plattforms are in very good repaire and
Lookes nobly, all marble full of towers w<sup>th</sup> stone Balls
on the top and Gilt on the top; the Entrance being by an
ascent up a hill Looks very noble over 2 drawbridges and
Gates, w<sup>ch</sup> are Marble as is the whole, Well Carv’d, the Gate
w<sup>th</sup> armory and statues all Gilt and on the top 7 Gold balls.
Ye buildings within are very neate, a Large appartment for
the Governour, w<sup>th</sup> others that are Less for y<sup>e</sup> severall
officers. There is a Long building alsoe w<sup>ch</sup> is y<sup>e</sup> arsnell for
y<sup>e</sup> arms and amunition, and just by it a round building well
secured w<sup>ch</sup> was for the powder round the works in the Plattform
for the Gunns w<sup>ch</sup> are well mounted and very well kept.
Walking round I had the view of all the town and alsoe
part off y<sup>e</sup> Main Ocean in w<sup>ch</sup> are some jslands. There is
S<sup>t</sup> Nicholas jsland w<sup>th</sup> a ffort in it, there it was Harry Martin
one of y<sup>e</sup> Kings judges was banished Dureing Life. There
you Can just Discover a Light house w<sup>ch</sup> is building on a
meer Rock in the middle of y<sup>e</sup> sea, this is 7 Leagues off, it
will be of Great advantage for y<sup>e</sup> Guide of y<sup>e</sup> shipps y<sup>t</sup> pass
that way. From this you have a Good refflection on y<sup>e</sup>
Great Care and provision y<sup>e</sup> wise God makes for all persons
and things in his Creation, that there should be in some
places where there is any Difficulty rocks Even in the
midst of y<sup>e</sup> deep w<sup>ch</sup> Can be made use of for a Constant
Guide and mark for the passengers on their voyages, but
the Earth is full of y<sup>e</sup> goodness of y<sup>e</sup> Lord and soe is this
Great sea wherein are jnumerable beings Created and
preserv’d by y<sup>e</sup> same almighty hand Whose is the Earth
and all things there in, he is Lord of all. From the plattform
I Could see y<sup>e</sup> Dock and also just ag<sup>st</sup> it I saw mount
EdgeComb a seate of S<sup>r</sup> Richard EdgComes, it stands on
the side of a hill all bedeck’d w<sup>th</sup> woods w<sup>ch</sup> are Divided into
several Rowes of trees in walks, the house being all of this
white marble. Its built round a Court so the four sides are
alike, at y<sup>e</sup> Corners of it are towers w<sup>ch</sup> w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Lanthorne or
Cupilow in the middle Lookes well, the house is not very
Lofty nor the windows high but it Looked Like a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>uniforme neate building and pretty Large. There is a
Long Walke from one part of y<sup>e</sup> front down to y<sup>e</sup> waterside,
w<sup>ch</sup> is on a descent guarded w<sup>th</sup> shady Rowes of trees, there
is a fine terrass walled in, at y<sup>e</sup> water side is open gates in y<sup>e</sup>
middle and a sumer house at Each End, from whence a
wall is Drawn Round the house and Gardens and a Large
parck, the wall of which I Rode by a good while; so y<sup>t</sup>
altogether and its scituation makes it Esteemed by me the
finest seate I have seen and might be more Rightly named
mount pleasant. From Plymouth I went 1 mile to Cribly
Fferry w<sup>ch</sup> is a very hazardous passage by reason of 3 tydes
meeting. Had I known y<sup>e</sup> Danger before, I should not
have been very willing to have gone it, not but this is y<sup>e</sup>
Constant way all people goe, and saved severall miles rideings,
I was at Least an hour going over, it was about a mile
but Indeed in some places notwithstanding there was 5 men
Row’d and I sett my own men to Row alsoe I do believe
we made not a step of way for almost a quarter of an hour,
but blessed be God I Came safely over; but those fferry
boates are soe wet and then the sea and wind is allwayes
Cold to be upon, that I never faile to Catch Cold in a fferry
boate as I did this day haveing 2 more fferrys to Cross tho’
none soe bad or halfe soe Long as this. Thence to Milbrooke
2 mile and went all along by the water and had the full
view of ye Dock yards. Here I entred into Cornwall and
soe passed over many very steep stony hills, tho’ here I had
some 2 or 3 miles of Exceeding good way on the downs,
and then I Came to y<sup>e</sup> steep precipices—Great Rocky hills—ever
and anon I Came down to the sea and Rode by its
side on the sand, then mounted up againe on y<sup>e</sup> hills w<sup>ch</sup>
Carryed me along Mostly in sight of y<sup>e</sup> Southsea. Sometymes
I was in Lanes full of Rowes of trees and then I
Came down a very steep stony hill to Lonn 13 mile, and
here I Crossed a Little arme of y<sup>e</sup> sea on a Bridge of 14
arches. This is a pretty bigg seaport, a Great many Little
houses all of stone, and steep hill much worse and 3 tymes
as Long as Dean Clapper hill, and soe I continued up and
down hill. Here Indeed I met w<sup>th</sup> more jnclosed Ground
and soe had more Lanes and a Deeper Clay Road w<sup>ch</sup> by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>the raine y<sup>e</sup> night before had made it very Dirty and full
of water in many places, in the Road there are many holes
and sloughs where Ever there is Clay Ground, and when by
raines they are filled with water its difficult to shun Danger;
here my horse was quite down in one of these holes full of
water but by y<sup>e</sup> good hand of God’s providence w<sup>ch</sup> has
allwayes been w<sup>th</sup> me Even a present help in tyme of need,
for giving him a good strap he fflounc’d up againe tho’ he
had gotten quite down his head and all, yet did retrieve his
ffeete and gott Cleer off y<sup>e</sup> place w<sup>th</sup> me on his Back. Soe
I Came to Hoile 8 mile more, they are very Long miles y<sup>e</sup>
ffarther West but you have y<sup>e</sup> pleasure of Rideing as if in a
Grove in most places, y<sup>e</sup> Regular Rowes of trees on Each
side y<sup>e</sup> Roade as if it were an Entrance into some gentlemans
Ground to his house. I fferryed over againe Cross an
arme of y<sup>e</sup> sea, here it was not broad but Exceeding deep.
This is y<sup>e</sup> Southsea w<sup>ch</sup> runs into many Little Creekes
for severall miles into y<sup>e</sup> Land w<sup>ch</sup> is all y<sup>e</sup> rivers they have.
I observed this to be exceeding salt and as green as ever I
saw y<sup>e</sup> sea when I have been a League or two out from y<sup>e</sup>
Land, w<sup>ch</sup> shews it must be very deep and Great tides.
This Hoile is a narrow stony town, y<sup>e</sup> streetes very Close,
and as I descended a Great steep into y<sup>e</sup> town, soe I
ascended one up a stony Long hill farre worse and full of
shelves and Rocks and 3 tymes as Long as Dean Clapperhill,
w<sup>ch</sup> I Name because when I was there they would
have frighted me with its terribleness as y<sup>e</sup> most inaccessible
place as Ever was and none Like it, and my opinion
is y<sup>t</sup> it was but one or two steps, to other places forty steps
and them w<sup>th</sup> more hazard than this of Dean Clapper.
Well, to pass on, I went over some Little heath Ground
but mostly Lanes, and those stony and Dirty, 3 mile and
halfe to Parr; here I fferry’d over againe, not but when the
tyde is out you may ford it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I went over the heath to S<sup>t</sup> Austins w<sup>ch</sup> is a
Little market town where I Lay, but their houses are like
Barnes up to y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup> house. Here was a pretty good
dineing room and Chamber within it and very neate
Country women. My Landlady brought me one of y<sup>e</sup> west
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Country tarts this was y<sup>e</sup> first I met w<sup>th</sup> though. I had
asked for them in many places in Sommerset and Devonshire;
its an apple pye w<sup>th</sup> a Custard all on the top, its y<sup>e</sup>
most acceptable entertainment y<sup>t</sup> Could be made me.
They scald their Creame and milk in most parts of those
Countrys and so its a sort of Clouted Creame as we Call it,
w<sup>th</sup> a Little sugar and soe put on y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup> apple Pye.
I was much pleased w<sup>th</sup> my supper tho’ not with the
Custome of the Country w<sup>ch</sup> is a universall smoaking, both
men women and children have all their pipes of tobacco in
their mouths and soe sit round the fire smoaking w<sup>ch</sup> was
not delightfull to me when I went down to talke w<sup>th</sup> my
Landlady for jnformation of any matter and Customs
amongst them. I must say they are as Comely sort of
women as I have seen any where tho’ in ordinary dress—good
black Eyes and Crafty enough and very neate. Halfe
a mile from hence they blow their tin w<sup>ch</sup> went to see.
They take y<sup>e</sup> ore and pound it in a stamping mill w<sup>ch</sup>
resembles the paper mills, and when its fine as y<sup>e</sup> finest
sand—some of w<sup>ch</sup> I saw and took—this they fling into a
ffurnace and w<sup>th</sup> it Coale to make the fire. So it burns
together and makes a violent heate and fierce flame, the
mettle by y<sup>e</sup> fire being separated from y<sup>e</sup> Coale and its own
Drosse, being heavy falls down to a trench made to receive
it at y<sup>e</sup> furnace hole below. This Liquid mettle I saw them
shovel up w<sup>th</sup> an jron shovel and soe pour it into molds in
w<sup>ch</sup> it Cooles and soe they take it thence in sort of wedges
or piggs I think they Call them, its a fine mettle in its first
melting—Looks Like silver—I had a piece poured out and
made Cold for to take w<sup>th</sup> me. Y<sup>e</sup> oare as its just dug
Lookes Like y<sup>e</sup> thunderstones, a greenish hue full of
pendust this seemes to Containe its full description, y<sup>e</sup>
shineing part is white. I went a mile farther on y<sup>e</sup> hills
and soe Came where they were digging in the tinn mines,
there was at Least 20 mines all in sight w<sup>ch</sup> employs a
Great many people at work almost night and day, but
Constantly all and Every day jncluding the Lords day w<sup>ch</sup>
they are forced to prevent their mines being overflowed w<sup>th</sup>
water. More than 1000 men are taken up about them, few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>mines but had then almost 20 men and boys attending it
either down in y<sup>e</sup> mines digging and Carrying y<sup>e</sup> oare to
the Little Bucket w<sup>ch</sup> Conveys it up, or Else others are
Draineing the water and Looking to y<sup>e</sup> Engines y<sup>t</sup> are
draineing it, and those above are attending y<sup>e</sup> drawing up
the oare in a sort of windlass as is to a Well. Two men
keeps turning bringing up one and Letting down another,
they are much Like the Leather Buckets they use in
London to put out fire, w<sup>ch</sup> hang up in Churches and Great
mens halls. They have a Great Labour and Great expence
to draine the mines of the water w<sup>th</sup> mills that horses turn,
and now they have y<sup>e</sup> mills or water Engines that are
turned by the water w<sup>ch</sup> is Convey’d on frames of timber
and truncks to hold y<sup>e</sup> water, w<sup>ch</sup> falls down on y<sup>e</sup> wheeles
as an over shott mill, and these are y<sup>e</sup> sort that turns y<sup>e</sup>
water into y<sup>e</sup> severall towns I have seen about London,
Darby and Exeter and many places more. They do five
tymes more good than the mills they use to turn w<sup>th</sup> horses,
but then they are much more Chargeable. Those mines do
require a great deale of timber to support them and to
make all those engines and mills, w<sup>ch</sup> makes fewell very
scarce here; they burn mostly turffs w<sup>ch</sup> is an unpleasant
smell, it makes one smell as if smoaked Like Bacon.
This ore as said is made fine powder in a Stamping Mill
w<sup>ch</sup> is Like y<sup>e</sup> paper mills, only these are pounded drye and
noe water Let into them as is to y<sup>e</sup> Raggs, to work them
into a paste. Ye mills are all turned w<sup>th</sup> a Little Streame
or Channell of water you may step over, jndeed they have
noe other mills but such in all the Country; I saw not a
windmill all over Cornwall or Devonshire tho’ they have
wind and hills Enough, and it may be its too Bleake for
them. In the tinn mines there is stone Dug out and a sort
of spar something Like what I have seen in the Lead
mines at Darbyshire but it seemed more sollid and hard, it
shines and Lookes Like mother of pearle. They alsoe digg
out stones as Cleer as Christal w<sup>ch</sup> is Called Cornish
Diamonds. I saw one as bigg as my two ffists, very Cleer
and Like some pieces of Chrystal my father brought from
y<sup>e</sup> Alps In Italy w<sup>ch</sup> I have by me. I got one of those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>pieces of their Cornish Diamonds as Long as halfe my
finger w<sup>ch</sup> had three or four flatt sides w<sup>th</sup> Edges, the top
was sharpe and so hard as it would Cut a Letter on glass.
Thence I went to —— 6 miles good way, and passed
by 100 mines some on which they were at work, others
that were lost by y<sup>e</sup> waters overwhelming them. I crossed
y<sup>e</sup> water on a Long stone bridge and so through dirty stony
Lanes 3 mile and then I Came into a broad Coach Rode
which I have not seen since I Left Exeter, so I went 3
mile more to M<sup>r</sup> Boscawens—Trygothy—a Relation of
mine. His house stands on a high hill in the middle of a
parke with severall Rows of trees with woods beyond it.
Y<sup>e</sup> house is built all of white stone like the Rough Coarse
Marble and Cover’d w<sup>th</sup> slate. They use much Lime in
their Cement w<sup>ch</sup> makes both walls and Cover Look very
white. There is a Court walled round w<sup>th</sup> open Iron gates
and barrs. The Entrance is up a few stone steps into a
Large high hall and so to a passage that Leads foreright
up a good stair Case. On y<sup>e</sup> Right side is a Large
Common parlour for Constant Eating in, from whence goes
a Little roome for smoaking y<sup>t</sup> has a back way into the
kitchin, and on the Left hand is a Great parlour and
drawing roome—wanscoated all very well but plaine. Y<sup>e</sup>
Great Parlour is Cedar, out of y<sup>t</sup> is the Drawing-roome
which is hung with pictures of the family, that goes into y<sup>e</sup>
garden w<sup>ch</sup> has Gravell walks round and across, but y<sup>e</sup>
squares are full of goosebery and shrub-trees and Looks
more Like a Kitchen garden as Lady Mary Boscawen told
me, out of w<sup>ch</sup> is another Garden and orchard which is
something Like a Grove, Green walks w<sup>th</sup> rows of fruit trees.
Its Capable of being a fine place w<sup>th</sup> some Charge, the
roomes above are new modell’d, 3 roomes wanscoated and
hung as y<sup>e</sup> new way is, and y<sup>e</sup> beds made up well, one red
damaske, another Green, another wrought some of y<sup>e</sup>
Ladyes own work and well made up, w<sup>ch</sup> is her own Roome
w<sup>th</sup> a dressing roome by it. There is a dressing roome
and a roome for a servant just by y<sup>e</sup> best Chamber.
There are two other good roomes unalter’d w<sup>th</sup> old hangings
to y<sup>e</sup> bottom on wrought work of y<sup>e</sup> first Ladyes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>Lady Margets work, y<sup>t</sup> was my Cos’n German, within that
roome was a servants roome and back staires, there was
just such another apartment on y<sup>e</sup> other side.</p>

<p class='c012'>Between all from the staires a broad passage Leads to a
Balcony over the Entrance w<sup>ch</sup> Look’d very pleasantly over
the parke but in the Cupulo on y<sup>e</sup> Leads I Could see a vast
way, at Least 20 mile round; for this house stands very
high to y<sup>e</sup> Land side Eastward, and the south was the Great
Ocean w<sup>ch</sup> runns into Falmouth thats y<sup>e</sup> best harbour for
shipps in that road. 6 mile from this place westward was
to Truro and the north to the hills full of Copper mines.
Here I was very Civily Entertained: from thence I returned
back Intending not to goe to y<sup>e</sup> Lands End w<sup>ch</sup> was 30
miles farther for feare of y<sup>e</sup> raines that fell in the night w<sup>ch</sup>
made me doubt what travelling I should have; soe to S<sup>t</sup>
Culumb I went, a pretty Long 12 mile. Here I met with
many Rowes of Elm trees w<sup>ch</sup> I have not found in any
Country Except Wiltshire; these were mostly soe, tho’
there were alsoe ashes and oakes. Y<sup>e</sup> hedges were Hazelthorne
and Holly but to see soe many good rowes of trees
on y<sup>e</sup> road is surprising and Looks Like the Entrance to
some Gentlemans house, and I cannot tell but some of them
were soe tho’ a mile off from y<sup>e</sup> house.</p>

<p class='c012'>The next day finding it faire weather on y<sup>e</sup> Change of y<sup>e</sup>
moone, I alter’d my Resolution and soe went for y<sup>e</sup> Lands
End by Redruth 18 miles, mostly over heath and Downs
w<sup>ch</sup> was very bleake and full of mines.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here I Came by the Copper mines w<sup>ch</sup> have the same
order in the digging and draining, tho’ here it seemes Dryer
and I believe not quite soe annoy’d w<sup>th</sup> water. The ore is
something as the tinn only this Looks blackish, or rather a
purple Colour, and y<sup>e</sup> glistering part is yellow as y<sup>e</sup> other
was white. They do not melt it here but ship it off to
Bristol by y<sup>e</sup> North Sea w<sup>ch</sup> I Rode in sight of, and is not
above 2 or 3 Mile from hence, which supplyes them with
Coales for their fewell at Easyer rates than the other side
Plymouth and the South Sea, because since y<sup>e</sup> warre they
Could not Double y<sup>e</sup> poynt at y<sup>e</sup> Lands End, being so neer
Ffrance y<sup>e</sup> pirats or Privateers met them. Indeed at S<sup>t</sup> Jves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>they do melt a Little but nothing that is Considerable—that
is 10 mile from Redruth w<sup>ch</sup> is a Little market town. Here
they Carry all their things on horses backs soe that of a
market day w<sup>ch</sup> was Fryday you see a great number of
horses Little of size w<sup>ch</sup> they Call Cornish Canelys. They
are well made and strong and will trip along as Light on
the stony road without injury to themselves, where as my
horses went so heavy that they wore their shoes immediately
thinn and off, but here I met with a very good smith that
shooed y<sup>e</sup> horses as well as they do in London, and that is
not Common in the Country, but here I found it soe, and at
a place in Westmoreland by y<sup>e</sup> ffells a smith made good
shoes and set them on very well. From Redruth I went to
Pensands 15 mile and passed by y<sup>e</sup> ruines of Great ffortification
or Castle on a high hill about 3 mile from Redruth and
passed to Hailes and soe went by y<sup>e</sup> sea side a great way, it
being spring tide it was a full sea. Just over against it there
was a Church w<sup>ch</sup> was almost sunck into y<sup>e</sup> sands being a
very sandy place. So I went up pretty high hills and over
some heath or Common, on w<sup>ch</sup> a Great storme of haile and
raine met me and drove fiercely on me but y<sup>e</sup> wind soone
dry’d my Dust Coate. Here I Came by a very good Grove
of trees w<sup>ch</sup> I thought was by some Gentlemans house but
found it some ffarmers.</p>

<p class='c012'>The people here are very ill Guides and know but Little
from home, only to some market town they frequent, but
will be very solicitous to know where you goe and how farre
and from whence you Came and where is y<sup>e</sup> abode. Then
I Came in sight of y<sup>e</sup> hill in Cornwall Called y<sup>e</sup> Mount, its
on a Rock in the sea w<sup>ch</sup> at y<sup>e</sup> flowing tyde is an jsland, but
at Low water one Can goe over y<sup>e</sup> sands almost just to it,
its but a Little market town w<sup>ch</sup> is about 2 mile from Panzants,
and you may walke or Ride to it all on y<sup>e</sup> sands
when y<sup>e</sup> tyde’s out. Its a ffine Rock and very high—severall
Little houses for fisher men—in y<sup>e</sup> sides of it just by
the water. At y<sup>e</sup> top is a pretty good house where the
Govenour Lives sometymes,—S<sup>r</sup> —— Hook his name is—there
is a tower on the top on w<sup>ch</sup> is a fflag. There is a
Chaire or throne on the top from whence they Can discover a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Great way at sea and here they put up Lights to direct
shipps.</p>

<p class='c012'>Pensands is Rightly named being all sands about it—it
Lies just as a shore to y<sup>e</sup> maine South ocean w<sup>ch</sup> Comes
from y<sup>e</sup> Lizard and being on y<sup>e</sup> side of a hill w<sup>th</sup> a high
hill all round y<sup>e</sup> side to y<sup>e</sup> Landward it Lookes soe snugg
and warme, and truely it needs shelter haveing the sea on
y<sup>e</sup> other side and Little or no ffewell—turff and ffurse and
fferne. They have Little or noe wood and noe Coale w<sup>ch</sup>
differences it from Darbyshire, otherwise this and to y<sup>e</sup>
Land’s End is stone and barren as Darbyshire. I was
surprised to ffind my supper boyling on a fire allwayes
supply’d w<sup>th</sup> a bush of ffurse and y<sup>t</sup> to be y<sup>e</sup> only ffewell to
dress a joynt of meat and broth, and told them they Could
not roast me anything, but they have a Little wood for
such occasions but its scarce and dear w<sup>ch</sup> is a strange
thing y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> shipps should not supply them. They told me
it must all be brought round the Lands End and since y<sup>e</sup>
warre they Could not have it. This town is two parishes,
one Church in y<sup>e</sup> town and a Little Chappell and another
Church belonging to y<sup>e</sup> other parish w<sup>ch</sup> is a mile distance.
There is alsoe a good meeteing place.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a good Key and a good Harbour for y<sup>e</sup> shipps
to Ride, by meanes of y<sup>e</sup> point of Land w<sup>ch</sup> runns into y<sup>e</sup>
Sea in a neck or Compass w<sup>ch</sup> shelters it from y<sup>e</sup> maine
and answers the Lizard point w<sup>ch</sup> you see very plaine—a
point of Land Looks Like a Double hill one above y<sup>e</sup> other
that runns a good way into y<sup>e</sup> sea. Y<sup>e</sup> Lands End is
10 mile ffarther, pretty steep and narrow Lanes, but its not
shelter’d w<sup>th</sup> trees or hedg Rows this being rather desart
and Like y<sup>e</sup> peake Country in Darbyshire, dry stone walls,
and y<sup>e</sup> hills full of stones, but it is in most places better
Land and yeilds good Corne, both wheate Barley and oates
and some Rhye. About 2 mile from the Lands End I
Came in sight of y<sup>e</sup> maine ocean on both sides, the south
and north sea and soe Rode in its view till I saw them
joyn’d at y<sup>e</sup> poynt, and saw the jsland of Sily w<sup>ch</sup> is 7
Leagues off y<sup>e</sup> Lands End. They tell me that in a Cleer
day those in the Island Can discern the people in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>maine as they goe up y<sup>e</sup> hill to Church, they Can Describe
their Clothes. This Church and Little parish w<sup>ch</sup> is Called
Church town is about a mile from the poynt. The
houses are but poor Cottages Like Barns to Look on, much
Like those in Scotland, but to doe my own Country its
right y<sup>e</sup> Inside of their Little Cottages are Clean and
plaister’d and such as you might Comfortably Eate and
drink in, and for Curiosity sake I dranck there and met w<sup>th</sup>
very good bottled ale. The Lands End terminates in a
poynt or Peak of Great Rocks w<sup>ch</sup> runs a good way into y<sup>e</sup>
sea, I Clamber’d over them as farre as safety permitted me,
there are abundance of Rocks and Sholes of stones stands
up in the sea a mile off some here and there, some quite to
y<sup>e</sup> shore, w<sup>ch</sup> they name by severall names of Knights and
Ladies Roled up in mantles from some old tradition or
ffiction—Y<sup>e</sup> poets advance description of y<sup>e</sup> amours of some
Great persons; but these many Rocks and Stones w<sup>ch</sup>
Lookes Like y<sup>e</sup> Needles in y<sup>e</sup> Isle of Wight makes it
hazardous for shipps to double y<sup>e</sup> poynt Especially in
stormy weather. Here at y<sup>e</sup> Lands end they are but a
Little way off of France, 2 dayes saile at farthest Convey
them to Hauve de Grace in France, but y<sup>e</sup> peace being but
newly entred into w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Ffrench I was not willing to
venture at Least by myself into a fforreign Kingdom, and
being then at y<sup>e</sup> End of y<sup>e</sup> Land, my horses Leggs Could
not Carry me through y<sup>e</sup> deep, and so return’d againe to
Pensands 10 mile more, and soe Came in view of both y<sup>e</sup>
seas and saw y<sup>e</sup> Lizard point and Pensands and y<sup>e</sup> Mount
in Cornwall w<sup>ch</sup> Looked very fine in y<sup>e</sup> broad day, the sunn
shineing on y<sup>e</sup> rocke in y<sup>e</sup> sea. Then I continued my
returne from Pensands to Hailing and now y<sup>e</sup> tyde was
down and so much Land appeared w<sup>ch</sup> lay under water
before, and I might have forded quite a crosse, many y<sup>t</sup>
know y<sup>e</sup> country do, but I tooke y<sup>e</sup> safer way round by y<sup>e</sup>
bridge. Here is abundance of very good Fish tho’ they
are so ill supply’d at Pensands because they carry it all up
y<sup>e</sup> Country East and Southward. This is an arme of y<sup>e</sup>
North Sea w<sup>ch</sup> runs in a greate way into y<sup>e</sup> Land, its a
Large Bay when y<sup>e</sup> sea comes in and upon y<sup>e</sup> next hill I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>ascended from it could discover it more plaine to be a deep
water and y<sup>e</sup> supply of y<sup>e</sup> maine ocean. Just by here lay
some ships and I perceived as I went, there being a Storme,
it seemed very tempestious and is a hazardous place in the
high tides; so I came to Redruth. I perceive they are
very bleake in these Countryes especially to this North
Ocean and y<sup>e</sup> winds so troublesome they are forced to spin
straw and so make a caul or net work to lay over their
thatch on their Ricks and out houses, w<sup>th</sup> waites of Stones
round to defend y<sup>e</sup> thatch from being blown away by y<sup>e</sup>
greate winds, not but they have a better way of thatching
their Houses w<sup>th</sup> Reeds and so close y<sup>t</sup> when its well done
will last twenty yeares, but what I mention of braces or
bands of straw is on their Rickes w<sup>ch</sup> only is to hold a
yeare. These places as in some other parts, indeed all over
Cornwall and Devonshire, they have their carryages on
horses backes, this being y<sup>e</sup> time of harvest, tho’ later in y<sup>e</sup>
yeare than usuall being y<sup>e</sup> middle of septemb<sup>r</sup>, but I had y<sup>e</sup>
advantage of seeing their harvest bringing in, w<sup>ch</sup> is on a
horse’s backe w<sup>th</sup> sort of crookes of wood like yokes on
either side—two or three on a side stands up in w<sup>ch</sup> they
stow y<sup>e</sup> corne and so tie it w<sup>th</sup> cords, but they cannot so
equally poise it but y<sup>e</sup> going of y<sup>e</sup> horse is like to cast it
down sometimes on y<sup>e</sup> one side and sometimes on y<sup>e</sup> other,
for they load them from y<sup>e</sup> neck to y<sup>e</sup> taile and pretty high
and are forced to support it w<sup>th</sup> their hands, so to a horse
they have two people, and the women leads and supports
them as well as y<sup>e</sup> men and goe through thick and thinn—sometymes
I have met with half a score horses thus
Loaded—they are Indeed but Little horses their Canelles
as they Call them, and soe may not be able to draw a Cart,
otherwise I am sure 3 or 4 horses might draw 3 tymes as
much as 4 horses does Carry and where it is open Ground
and roads broad, w<sup>ch</sup> in some places here it was, I wondred
at their Labour in this kind, for the men and the women
themselves toiled Like their horses, but the Common
observation of Custom being as a second nature people are
very hardly Convinc’d or brought off from, tho’ never soe
jnconvenient.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span> From Redruth I went to Truro 8 mile, w<sup>ch</sup> is a pretty
Little town and seaport and formerly was Esteemed the
best town in Cornwall, now is the second next Lanstone.
Its just by y<sup>e</sup> Copper and tinn mines and Lies down in a
bottom, pretty steep ascent as most of the towns in these
Countrys, that you would be afraid of tumbling w<sup>th</sup> nose
and head foremost. Ye town is built of stone—a good
pretty Church built all stone and Carv’d on y<sup>e</sup> outside, it
stands in y<sup>e</sup> middle of y<sup>e</sup> town, and just by there is a market
house on stone pillars and hall on y<sup>e</sup> top; there is alsoe a
pretty good key. This was formerly a great tradeing town
and flourish’d in all things, but now as there is in all places
their Rise and period soe this, w<sup>ch</sup> is become a Ruinated
disregarded place. Here is a very good meeteing but I
was hindred by y<sup>e</sup> raine y<sup>e</sup> Lords day Else should have
Come to hearing, and so was forced to stay where I Could
hear but one Sermon at y<sup>e</sup> Church, but by it saw y<sup>e</sup>
fashion of y<sup>e</sup> Country being obliged to go a mile to y<sup>e</sup>
parish Church over some Grounds w<sup>ch</sup> are divided by
such stiles and bridges uncommon, and I never saw any
such before; they are severall stones fixed aCross and so
are Like a Grate or Large Steps over a Ditch that is full of
mudd or water, and over this just in the middle is a Great
stone fixed side wayes w<sup>ch</sup> is the style to be Clambered
over. These I find are the ffences and Guards of their
Grounds one from another, and Indeed they are very
troublesome and dangerous for strangers and Children. I
heard a pretty good Sermon but that w<sup>ch</sup> was my Greatest
pleasure was the good Landlady I had, she was but an
ordinary plaine woman but she was understanding in the
best things as most,—y<sup>e</sup> Experience of reall religion and
her quiet submision and self Resignation to y<sup>e</sup> will of God
in all things, and especially in y<sup>e</sup> placeing her in a remoteness
to y<sup>e</sup> best advantages of hearing, and being in such
a publick Employment w<sup>ch</sup> she desired and aimed at y<sup>e</sup>
discharging soe as to adorne y<sup>e</sup> Gospel of her Lord and
Saviour, and the Care of her Children. Indeed I was
much pleased and Edify’d by her Conversation and y<sup>e</sup>
pitch of Soul Resignation to y<sup>e</sup> will of God and thankfulness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>that God Enabled and owned her there in, was an
attainment few reach y<sup>t</sup> have greater advantages of Learning
and knowing y<sup>e</sup> mind of God. But this plainly Led
me to see that as God himself teacheth soe as none
teacheth Like him, soe he Can Discover himself to those
immediately y<sup>t</sup> have not the opportunity of seeing him in
his sanctuary, and therefore to him we must address for
help in this or any Duty he Calls us to, both in the use of
what meanes he appoynts as alsoe for success and blessing
on it.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Truro w<sup>ch</sup> is 9 mile from Ffallmouth and 4 mile
from Trygolny w<sup>ch</sup> was y<sup>e</sup> place I was at before w<sup>th</sup> my
Relation, that would have Engaged my stay with them a
few dayes or weekes to have given me the diversion of the
Country, and to have heard the Cornish nightingales as
they Call them, the Cornish Chough—a sort of Jackdaw if
I mistake not—a Little black bird w<sup>ch</sup> makes them a visit
about Michaelmas and gives them y<sup>e</sup> diversion of the notes
w<sup>ch</sup> is a Rough sort of musick not unlike y<sup>e</sup> Bird I take
them for, so I believe they by way of jest put on the
Cornish Gentlemen by Calling them nightingales; but the
season of the year enclined to raine and y<sup>e</sup> dayes declineing
I was affraid to delay my Return, and these parts not
abounding w<sup>th</sup> much accomodation for horses, theirs being
a hard sort of Cattle and Live much on Grass or ffurses of
w<sup>ch</sup> they have y<sup>e</sup> most, and it will make them very ffatt
being Little hardy horses, and as they jest on themselves
do not Love the taste of oates and hay, because they never
permit them to know the taste of it. But my horses Could
not Live so, Especially on journeys, of w<sup>ch</sup> I had given them
a pretty exercise, and their new oates and hay suited not
their stomach. I Could get noe Beanes for them till I
Came back to S<sup>t</sup> Columbe againe w<sup>ch</sup> from Truro by S<sup>t</sup>
Mitchel was 12 miles mostly Lanes and Long miles. As I
observed before I saw noe windmills all these Countrys
over, they have only the mills w<sup>ch</sup> are overshott and a Little
rivulet of water you may step over turns them, w<sup>ch</sup> are the
mills for Grinding their Corn and their ore or what Else.
From S<sup>t</sup> Columbe I went to Way bridge 6 Long miles.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>There was a river w<sup>ch</sup> was flowed up by y<sup>e</sup> tyde a Greate
way up into the Land, it Came from y<sup>e</sup> north sea, it was
broad, y<sup>e</sup> bridge had 17 arches.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence to Comblefford over steep hills 9 mile more, some
of this way was over Commons of Black moorish Ground
full of Sloughs. The Lanes are deffended w<sup>th</sup> bancks
wherein are stones, some Great rocks, others slaty stones,
such as they use for tileing. Comblefford was a Little
market town but it was very indifferent accomodations, but
the raines y<sup>t</sup> night and next morning made me take up
there till about 10 oClock in the morning; it then made a
shew of Cleering up made me willing to seek a better
Lodging. 2 mile from this place is a Large standing water
Called Dosenmere poole in a Black moorish Ground and is
fed by no rivers except the Little rivulets from some high
hills yet seemes allwayes full w<sup>th</sup> out Diminution and flows
w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> wind and is stored with good ffish, and people Living
near it take y<sup>e</sup> pleasure in a boate to goe about it. There
is alsoe good wildfowle about it; it seemes so be such a
water as the mer at Whitlesome in Huntingtonshire by
Stilton its fresh water and what supply it has must be the
rivulets y<sup>e</sup> must Come from y<sup>e</sup> south sea being that wayward
towards Plymouth. As I travelled I Came in sight of a
great mountaine esteemed the second highest hill in
England supposeing y<sup>e</sup> account Black Combe in Cumberland
y<sup>e</sup> first, but really I have seen soe many Great and
high hills I Cannot attribute preeminence to Either of these
tho’ this did Look very Great and tall, but I thinke its
better said the highest hill in each County.</p>

<p class='c012'>I travelled 4 pretty Long miles much in Lanes and then
Came into a Common where I Cross’d the Great roads w<sup>ch</sup>
on the Right hand Leads a way to Plymouth and the south
sea, the Left hand to Bastable and the north sea, w<sup>ch</sup>
Conveys the stone or rather marble w<sup>ch</sup> they take from
hence at Bole, remarkable Quarrys for a Black stone,
Exceeding hard and Glossy Like marble, very Dureable for
pavements. This they send to all parts in tyme of peace
and London takes off much of it.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here I Rode over a Common or Down 4 mile Long in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>sight of y<sup>e</sup> North sea and saw Hartly poynt which is the
Earle of Baths just by his fine house Called Stow, his fine
stables of horses, and Gardens. There I discern’d the
Poynt very plaine and just by I saw the jsle of Lundy which
formerly belonged to my Grandfather William Lord
viscount Say and Seale, w<sup>ch</sup> does abound with ffish and
Rabbets and all sorts of ffowles, one bird y<sup>t</sup> Lives partly
in the water and partly out and so may be Called an
amphibious Creature, its true that one foote is Like a turky
the other a gooses foote; it Lays its Egg in a place the Sun
shines on and sets it so exactly upright on the small End
and there it remaines till taken up and all the art and skill
of persons Cannot set it up soe againe to abide. Here I
met with some showers w<sup>ch</sup> by fitts or storms held me,—to
Lanston 4 mile more, these 12 mile from Cambleford was
not Little ones and what with the wet and Dirty Lanes in
many places I made it a tedious journey. I Could see none
of the town till just I was as you may say ready to tumble
into it, there being a vast steep to descend to when the
town seemed in a bottom yet I was forced to ascend a
pretty good hill into the place. Lanston is the chief town
in Cornwall where the assizes are kept, I should have
remarked at y<sup>e</sup> Lands End that Pensands was the Last
Corporation in England, soe this is one of y<sup>e</sup> Last Great
towns tho’ noe Citty, for Cornwall is in y<sup>e</sup> Diocese of Devonshire
w<sup>ch</sup> is Exeter.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a Great ascent up into the Castle w<sup>ch</sup> Looks
very Great and in good repaire the walls and towers round
it, its true there is but a part of it remaines, the round tower
or fort being still standing and makes a good appearance.
The town is Encompass’d w<sup>th</sup> walls and gates, its’ pretty
Large tho’ you Cannot discover the whole town, being up
and down in so many hills. The streetes themselves are
very steep unless it be at the market place where is a Long
and handsome space set on stone pillars w<sup>th</sup> the town hall
on the top, w<sup>ch</sup> has a Large Lanthorne or Cupilo in the
middle, where hangs a bell for a Clock with a Dyal to the
streete. There is in this place 2 or 3 good houses built after
the London form by some Lawyers, Else the whole town is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>old houses of timber work. At a Little distance from the
town on a high hill I Looked back and had the full prospect
of the whole town which was of a pretty Large extent. A
mile beyond I crossed on a stone bridge over a river and
Entred into Devonshire againe, and pass’d through mostly
Lanes w<sup>ch</sup> were stony and dirty by reason of y<sup>e</sup> raines y<sup>t</sup>
ffell the night before, and this day, which was the wettest
day I had in all my summers travells, hitherto having had
noe more than a shower in a day and that not above 3
tymes in all except when I Came to Exeter. As I Came
down from Taunton there was small raine most of the afternoon
but this day was much worse, so that by that tyme I
Came through Lanes and some Commons to Oakingham
w<sup>ch</sup> was 15 mile I was very wet. This was a Little market
town and I met with a very good Inn and accomodation,
very good Chamber and bed and Came in by 5 of the Clock,
so had good tyme to take off my wet Cloathes and be well
dryed and warme to eate my supper, and rested very well
without sustaining y<sup>e</sup> Least damage by the wet. I should
have Remark’d that these roads were much up and down
hill thro’ enclosed Lands and woods in y<sup>e</sup> same manner the
other part of Cornwall and Devonshire was, gaineing by
degrees the upper Grounds by one hill to another and soe
descending them in Like manner. These raines fully
Convinced me of y<sup>e</sup> need of so many Great stone Bridges
whose arches were soe high that I have wonder’d at it
because the waters seemed shallow streames, but they were
so swelled by one night and dayes raine y<sup>t</sup> they Came up
pretty near the arches and ran in most places w<sup>th</sup> such
rapidity and Look’d so thick and troubled as if they would
Clear all before them. This Causes Great floods, and the
Lower Grounds are overwhelm’d for a season after such
raines, so that had I not put on and gotten beyond Lanston
that day there would have been noe moveing for me till the
flouds w<sup>ch</sup> hourly encreased were run off.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next day I went to Cochen Well 10 mile, mostly good
open way except a hill or two w<sup>ch</sup> were steep and stony,
tho’ this was the Longer way and about, yet by reason of
y<sup>e</sup> former raines it was the safest, for y<sup>e</sup> Lower way was run
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>over by the waters w<sup>ch</sup> are Land flouds from the swelling
Brookes, w<sup>ch</sup> are up in a few hours and are sunck in the
same tyme againe—the wayes were somewhat Dirty.
Thence to Exeter 10 mile more, but this was the basest
way you Can goe and made much worse by these
raines, but its narrow Lanes full of stones and Loose
ground, Clay, and now exceeding Slippery by the
raines.</p>

<p class='c012'>A quarter of a mile on this side of the town I stood on a
high banck from whence the prospect of y<sup>e</sup> Citty of Exeter
was very pleasant, Could see it to great advantage, y<sup>e</sup>
Cathedrall and other Churches Spires w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> whole town,
w<sup>ch</sup> in generall is well built, w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> good Bridge over y<sup>e</sup> Ex,
w<sup>ch</sup> is a fine river on whose Banckes are severall Rows of
trees all below the town. The walks all about it augments
the beauty of y<sup>e</sup> Citty. From whence I went to Topsham
3 miles which is a Little market place and a very good
Key; hither they Convey on horses their Serges and soe
Load their shipps w<sup>ch</sup> Comes to this place, all for London.
Thence I saw Starre Cross where the Great shipps Ride and
there they build some shipps. This was up the river, 5 or
6 miles up y<sup>e</sup> river, but the tide being out Could not goe and
it was ten mile by Land and their miles are soe Long here
I would not goe it seing almost as well the shipps y<sup>t</sup> Lay
there as if at the place.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I returned to Exeter 3 mile where I had been
very Kindly Entertained by M<sup>r</sup> Goswill and his wife, w<sup>ch</sup>
was one my broth<sup>r</sup> S<sup>r</sup> Edmond Harrison did Employ in
Buying Serges. From Exeter I went to Honiton 15 mile,
all fine Gravell way, y<sup>e</sup> best Road I have met with all in the
west. Here it is they make the fine bone lace in imitation
of the Antwerp and Flanders Lace and jndeed I think its as
fine—it only will not wash so fine, w<sup>ch</sup> must be the fault in
y<sup>e</sup> thread. Honiton is a pretty large place, a good market
house, near it a good Church w<sup>th</sup> a round tower and spire
w<sup>ch</sup> was very high and a Little peculiar in its forme, somewhat
Like a Pigeon house Rooffe. Here is a very Large
meeteing of Descenters. Thence I went to Axminster 7
mile more, but not soe good way being much in Lanes stony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>and Dirty and pretty much up and down hills, Like y<sup>e</sup> other
parts of those Countrys.</p>

<p class='c012'>Beyond Axminster where I passed over the river Ax on
a pretty Large Bridge I Came to Somersetshire againe.
This Axminster is a Little market town and the London
Road by Chard, but I struck out of that road 2 mile off
the town to Liegh w<sup>ch</sup> was 4 mile from Axminster, to a
Relations house M<sup>r</sup> Hendlys, w<sup>ch</sup> stands on a hill, but its
such an Enclosed Country and narrow Lanes you Cannot
see a Bow shott before you, and such up and down steep
hills. Its an old house, and Large Court w<sup>th</sup> open gates that
enter you into a passage, on the Right hand a good Parlour
new wanscoated, next that a Kitchen and pantrys Leads
into a Court where all the offices are and stable and Coach
houses. On the Left side of y<sup>e</sup> passage at y<sup>e</sup> Entrance is a
Large old hall w<sup>th</sup> a Great halfe pace at y<sup>e</sup> upper End w<sup>th</sup>
2 Chimneys in the hall. This Leades into a passage on the
Left hand and so through to another parlour w<sup>th</sup> good old
fashion Carved wanscoat. The roomes are low, out of y<sup>e</sup>
passage Leads up a paire of staires to 3 or 4 roomes all Low
and but one well furnished; then out of same passage
below is a doore into the Gardens w<sup>ch</sup> are one Lower
than the other with stone stepps, its Capable of being
very handsome if made with open Grates to set one
out to see y<sup>e</sup> orchards and woods beyond. They were
a turffing y<sup>e</sup> walks and makeing banks in order to it.
Y<sup>e</sup> house alsoe is Capable of alteration to a good house
if the windows were made Lower and y<sup>e</sup> roomes fitted
w<sup>th</sup> wanscoate and good ffurniture. Just to the front there
is design’d a visto to be Cut thro’ the wood to the water
side w<sup>ch</sup> will be very fine being on a descent.</p>

<p class='c012'>About a mile from hence is one M<sup>r</sup> Preadneas house, a
fine old house and well furnished but they permit none to
see it, soe I saw it not only drove by it to see my Cozens
Little Girle at nurse and soe returned home againe a mile,
and then from Liegh I went through narrow stony Lanes
up hills and down, w<sup>ch</sup> steeps Causes the water on raines to
trill down on the Low ground that for a few hours or a day
there will be noe passing in y<sup>e</sup> bottom, w<sup>ch</sup> happen’d while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>I was at Liegh; one nights Raine put the Cattle in the
meddows swimming and hindred us from going to Church,
the water would have Came over the windows of the Coach.
These stony Lanes I passed till I Came to the Great road
which Comes from Lime, here I Entred into Dorsetshire
and soe went through a Little town Called Maiden Newton
eight mile more, and soe thence to Dorchester town 6 mile
more; all a fine hard Gravel way and much on the downs—this
is good Ground and Much for sheep. Thence I went
to Blandford 12 Long miles thro’ Piddletown Milborn and
WhitChurch. There I staid with my relation Cos’n Collier,
Husys and Ffussells, thence to Salisbury 18 mile. When
I had passed 6 mile I Came through a Gate w<sup>ch</sup> brought
me into Wiltshire and soe over y<sup>e</sup> downs to Salisbury and
from thence to Newtontony 7 miles.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went from Newtontony to Sarum and home againe
3 tymes w<sup>ch</sup> made it 42 miles in all, then to Wallop
4 miles and home again 4 miles, and to Grattly
twice and back againe 12 mile, and to Cholderton twice
4 miles, to Allington and home 2 mile more, then to
London.</p>

<p class='c012'>From Newtontony to Winchester 15 mile, there I went to
see a Relation M<sup>rs</sup> Horne thence Alsford 8 mile. The
Little raines I had in the morning before I Left Newtontony
made the wayes very slippery, and it being mostly on
Chaulk way a Little before I Came to Alsford forceing my
horse out of the hollow way his feete failed and he Could
noe wayes recover himself, and soe I was shott off his neck
upon the Bank, but noe harm I bless God and as soone as
he Could role himself up stood stock still by me, which I
Looked on as a Great mercy—indeed mercy and truth all
wayes have attended me. The next day I went to Alton
10 miles thence Ffarnum 9 miles more. This proved a very
wet day, after an hours Rideing in the morning it never
Ceased more or Less to raine, w<sup>ch</sup> made me put in at
Ffarnum and stay all the day after I Came in at noone.
But then it began to raine much faster and soe Continued.
Thence next day I went over the fforest in sight of Ffairly
Castle w<sup>ch</sup> is the Bishop of Winchesters pallace, it Lookes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>nobly on a hill, thence to Bagshott 9 miles, thence to Winsor
over the fforest 7 Long miles, this way most Clay deep way,
the worse by reason of y<sup>e</sup> raines and full of Sloughs. About
a mile off Windsor Castle appeares standing on a hill much
after the manner of Durham w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> walls and battlements
round, only that is all stone and this is but partly soe and
y<sup>e</sup> rest Brick plaister’d over in imitation of stones w<sup>ch</sup> does
not Look so well. It is a pretty great ascent to y<sup>e</sup> town w<sup>ch</sup>
is well built, something suitable to London by reason of its
affinity to y<sup>e</sup> Court, and I saw the Cathedrall or S<sup>t</sup> Georges
Church w<sup>ch</sup> is very fine built all stone and Carved on
y<sup>e</sup> outside, severall Cloysters Leads to the Doctors houses—its
a Lofty noble building. The quire is properly S<sup>t</sup> Georges
Chappel whose Rooff is very high and Carved very Curiously,
all free stone, so is the rest of y<sup>e</sup> Church. There hangs up
y<sup>e</sup> Banners and Ensignes of honour belonging to y<sup>e</sup> Severall
Knights of the honourable order of y<sup>e</sup> blew garter, their
Complement is 26, there was one void at this tyme by the
Death of y<sup>e</sup> Earle of Peterborough. There is a Greate
Cerimony in their Inauguration, their seates are of Wanscoate
Carved which are all quite round the quire, w<sup>th</sup> Each
Garters and Coate armours and banners on the top, and
when they are jnstalled. their Garments are blew velvet,
in shape Like the Coapes, Lined w<sup>th</sup> white Sattin or silk,
that and their blew Garter in which hangs a George on
horseback besett w<sup>th</sup> jewels and a Diamond Garter put on
their Right Leg, which is performed by 2 of y<sup>e</sup> former
Knights of the order, which is given them by the King that
is the Principal of y<sup>t</sup> order. Then they have an oath Given
them to maintain the Rights and Cerimonyes of said order
and soe are seated in their seates. There are Great fees
paid by each new Knight to y<sup>e</sup> officers to the poore Knights
of Windsor, whose seates are just under y<sup>e</sup> Seates of the
Knights of y<sup>e</sup> Garter, 18 poore Knights of Windsor w<sup>ch</sup> have
houses provided for them about the Cloyster and 48<sup>£</sup> p<sup>r</sup>
annum each besides their perquisits at such tymes. There
are alsoe 18 singing men and petty Cannons, those that are
preachers has houses and 30<sup>lb</sup> p<sup>r</sup> annum each, but the others
have but 22<sup>lb</sup> each a yeare and houses to Live in. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>all have their ffees at the jnstalment of Each Knight of the
Garter and of this order are severall Princes and Great
men both here and in forreign Parts.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a very Large fine organ at y<sup>e</sup> Entrance of the
Quire, the alter is Crimson velvet striped w<sup>th</sup> Gold tissue,
Large Candlesticks and Basons Gilt. At the jnstallment
there is a Great deale of plaite set out w<sup>ch</sup> belongs to the
Chappel. Over the alter is a painting of Christ and his
twelve apostles at y<sup>e</sup> passover supper very naturally drawn,
and over it a Large window full of fine paintings—the
history of the testaments. Y<sup>e</sup> Quire is paved all with black
and white marble under which is a Large vault for y<sup>e</sup> Royal
family. There Lyes King Henry y<sup>e</sup> 8<sup>th</sup> and King Charles
the first &amp;c. There is in the Church a tombe and vault of
y<sup>e</sup> Duke of Norfolks familly w<sup>th</sup> steele Carvings all about it
very Curious, and to add to its variety it may be all taken
piece by piece and put up in a box, its a very Large thing
and great variety of work—this is on the Right side of the
alter.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is in a Little Chappel by, a very fine monument
with two Large Statues in alabast<sup>r</sup> Painted and gilt all at
Length in their garments, and round the tomb stone are
the Statues of their Children, 7 daughters, four of them were
twinns and soe represented being put together, and 3 sonnes,
all alabaster, and there is a role of matt under the head of
the Lord and Lady that was so naturall, Looked like real
Matt. This was Lord Earle Lincolns tomb. There is
another monument of the Earle of Rutlands, the first of the
family w<sup>ch</sup> was Earle 100 year since, it was in the yeare ano:
Dom: 1513: there is round that 6 Sonns and six Daughters
with Carvings of other Images holding their Coates of armes.
There is another monument w<sup>ch</sup> is of y<sup>e</sup> old Duke off
Beaufort who was base son to King Edward the 4<sup>th</sup>, and
therefore there is a barr of reproach aCross the English
arms w<sup>ch</sup> he bears. There is another statue of white
marble in a Leaneing posture almost Lyeing quite along
and they say its very Like his Effigie—this was the
Bishop of Chichester. There is another Bishops Effigie in
y<sup>e</sup> wall just to y<sup>e</sup> waste of alabaster. There is a Chappel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>in w<sup>ch</sup> are prayers at 8 of y<sup>e</sup> Clock at night. There is a
white marble ffont. The rooff of the quire is very Curious,
Carv’d stone and soe thinn to y<sup>e</sup> Leads one might grasp it
between thumb and finger, and yet so well fixt as to be
very strong. From thence I proceeded on to y<sup>e</sup> Castle w<sup>ch</sup>
is the finest pallace y<sup>e</sup> King has Especially now White hall
is burnt; but that was old buildings and unless it were the
banqueting house and the apartment which our good Queen
Mary beautifyed for herself that was never soe well as
Winsor. You Enter in through a gate; on the right hand
is a tower which is built w<sup>th</sup> Redouts and walks round it
as was Durham Castle. Its 120 stepps up where is the
Guard roome hung with armes, thence a Dineing roome, the
Duke of Norfolks appartment, a Drawing roome and two
bed Chambers, one w<sup>th</sup> a half bedstead as the new mode,
dimity w<sup>th</sup> fine shades of worstead works well made up—there
are good Pictures. The next roome has such a bed
but that is fine Indian quilting and Embroidery of silk.
The tower on the Leads is as many stepps more, I walked
round it and Could see a Great prospect of the whole town
and Winsor fforest and the Country round to Kensington, I
Could see Lord of Hollands house and Rowes of trees,
and to Harrow of the hill, and to Shooters hill beyond
London, and the town of Winsor Looked very well. There
were severall noblemens houses, Duke S<sup>t</sup> Albans and fine
Gardens, Just by it is the Lord Guidolphins house and
Gardens; there I Could see the fine walk or rather Road
planted with trees of a huge length into y<sup>e</sup> fforest, w<sup>ch</sup> King
Charles made for his going out in Diversion of shooteing,
and here I could see y<sup>e</sup> river Thames w<sup>ch</sup> twists and turns
itself round y<sup>e</sup> meddowes and Grounds. Upon this tower
w<sup>ch</sup> is most tymes moist, all in the walls grows y<sup>e</sup> best
maiden haire both white and black, w<sup>ch</sup> is an herb much
esteemed for Coughs and to put into Drinks for consumption.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I proceeded on to a Large Court Like the Quaderangle
at Christ Church College in Oxford, or Trinity in
Cambridge, in the middle of which is a statue of King
Charles y<sup>e</sup> Second on horseback all of brass, and is railed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>in w<sup>th</sup> Iron spikes; round this Court are the Buildings w<sup>ch</sup>
are y<sup>e</sup> severall appartments of the Lords of y<sup>e</sup> bed Chamber,
and the Ladies; also one side is the Lodgings belonging to
the princess Ann of Denmarke w<sup>ch</sup> are all of stone and well
built and beautifyed. In the middle you Enter a Large
pair of jron gates finely Carv’d into a paved Large space
supported w<sup>th</sup> several rows of Stone Pillars, and ascending
up Large Staires, which Enters you into the Queens Guard
Chamber hung full of armoury, w<sup>ch</sup> is so Exactly set, the
Pikes set up like Pillars and such distances, y<sup>e</sup> muskets
Laid a long one above the other y<sup>e</sup> boxes for y<sup>e</sup> powder,
and the Edge of y<sup>e</sup> Cornish is Pistols set as thick as they
can be set, and above it are drums and helmets and back
and breast armour. The Chimney piece is of y<sup>e</sup> same;
swords in the middle, there poynts turned outward, with a
round of Little Pistolls set Close in quarter Circle; its all
exactly uniforme and very handsome. Next into a noble
Hall w<sup>ch</sup> has very fine paintings, this is the Standard for
Curiosity in all places you see painting, its done by the
same hand did the paintings att Winsor. The top is full of
all sort of varietys, in the middle is King Charles’s Picture,
y<sup>e</sup> sides are all descriptions of Battles, and between Each
Picture in the Pillars is y<sup>e</sup> George and Blew garter and
Starre, at y<sup>e</sup> upper End is the Large Picture of S<sup>t</sup> George
Encountering y<sup>e</sup> dragon and at the Lower End is y<sup>e</sup> picture
of y<sup>e</sup> King that first Instituted this order of the Blew garter,
and in putting it on himself on his son, who was just returned
victor from some Considerable Battle. I should
have noted in my Remarks of the Cerimonies of that order
that when any Dies and a Garter Drops they make a solemn
offering up of all their Ensignes of honour to y<sup>e</sup> Church
and then take them down and pay some ffees as well as at
their Entrance into it. From this roome I Entred into y<sup>e</sup>
Chappel under the gallery or Closet the King and Queen
sets in at prayers, this was supported by four Brass Gyants
or Else painted Like Brass. This seate of y<sup>e</sup> Kings Lookes
into y<sup>e</sup> Chappel, its Crimson velvet, all the jnside and
Cannopy w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Cloth w<sup>ch</sup> hung over it all alike Richly
Embroyder’d with Gold fring. This is the house Chappel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>and is Exceeding beautifull, y<sup>e</sup> paintings of the rooffe and
the sides which is y<sup>e</sup> history of Christs miracles his Life and
the good he did in healing all distemper, w<sup>ch</sup> are described
at Large here and Lookes very Lively. There is alsoe the
most Exactest workmanship in y<sup>e</sup> wood Carving, which is
as the painting the pattern and masterpiece of all such
work, both in ffigures, fruitages, beasts, birds, fflowers, all
sorts, soe thinn y<sup>e</sup> wood, and all white natural wood without
varnish. This adorns the Pillars and void spaces between
the paintings, here is as Great qualiety so much for Quantety.
There was a pretty alter at y<sup>e</sup> upper End and two gallerys
for y<sup>e</sup> musick.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I went up staires into a Large dineing roome,
Damaske Chaires and window Curtaines, wanscoated, and
severall fine pictures. The Rooffe of this was well painted
also, but they are soe Lofty its enough to Breake ones neck
to Looke on them. Thence into a Gallery full of Pictures
w<sup>th</sup> a Large Looking Glass at y<sup>e</sup> End. Thence into y<sup>e</sup>
Drawing roome where is the Large Branch of silver, and
y<sup>e</sup> sconces round y<sup>e</sup> roome of silver, silver table, and stands,
and Glass frames, and Chaire frames. Next is y<sup>e</sup> queenes
Chamber of state, all Indian Embroidery on white Sattin
being presented to her by y<sup>e</sup> Comp<sup>y</sup>. On it is Great Plumes
of white ffeathers, there is very good tapistry hangings full
of gold and silver, but they are Large old ffigures. Here’s
a silver table, and stands, and Glass fframe. There was a
raile set a Cross at y<sup>e</sup> beds ffeete w<sup>ch</sup> reached Each side of
y<sup>e</sup> roome, made of sweate wood frames and open Wires in
y<sup>e</sup> middle, and was to be Doubled together in Leaves as a
screen: this was instead of y<sup>e</sup> raile use to be quite round y<sup>e</sup>
King and queens beds to keep off Companyes Coming near
them.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence into an anti-roome through a Little Gallery or
passage, thence into y<sup>e</sup> Kings dressing roome almost all
Glass; y<sup>e</sup> Chimney piece is full of Great stone heads in
nitches or hollows made for them, of some Emperours.
Y<sup>e</sup> windows of all y<sup>e</sup> roomes are Large sashes as big as a
good Looking-glass and are all diamond Cut round the
Edges, the height of y<sup>e</sup> windows makes them Looke narrow.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>Thence into the kings Constant bed Chamber, being one
of y<sup>e</sup> halfe bedsteads of Crimson and Green damaske, jnside
and outside the same hangings, and Chaires and
window Curtaines the same; it was Lofty and full with
good ffringe, and there was such another screen or raile at
y<sup>e</sup> ffeete of the bed that tooke y<sup>e</sup> Length of the roome as in
the queens Chamber; here was tables, stands, Glass frames,
Gilt gold, fine Carving on the Chimney pieces, both here and
in y<sup>e</sup> queens’ appartment. Y<sup>e</sup> next was ye Chamber of State
w<sup>ch</sup> is noble. Indeed, very Lofty and painted on y<sup>e</sup> roofe
as they all are. The bed was green velvet Strip’d down
very thick with Gold orrice Lace of my hands breadth, and
round the bottom 3 such orrices and Gold ffring all round
it and gold tassels; so was the Cornish. The jnside was
y<sup>e</sup> same, at the head piece was Like Curtaines ffringed
round w<sup>th</sup> gold and tyed back w<sup>th</sup> Gold strings and tassells
as it were tyed back and soe hung down in the middle,
where was the Crown and sypher Embroyder’d; the hangings
y<sup>e</sup> same and such another screen aCrosse the roome to
secure the bed from y<sup>e</sup> Common. Next this is the drawing
roome of state, the Cannopy and throne and y<sup>e</sup> part behind
is all green velvet Richly Embroyder’d with silver and
Gold, of high Emboss’d work, and some Curiously wrought
Like needlework that you Can scarce see y<sup>e</sup> Ground or stuff
its wrought on, and the Crown of Crimson velvet Embroyder’d
just over the Chaire or throne of state; the ffoot-stoole
the same, w<sup>ch</sup> was all set on a half pace or part raised
above y<sup>e</sup> rest as the manner is, with, a fine Carpet over it.
The Cannopy was so rich and Curled up and in some places
soe ffull it Looked very Glorious, and was newly made
to give audience to the Ffrench Embassadour to shew y<sup>e</sup>
Grandeur and magnificence of the British Monarch—some
of these ffoolerys are requisite sometymes to Create admiration
and regard to keep up the state of a kingdom and
nation.</p>

<p class='c012'>Thence I went into the Common audience roome, where
was a throne on such a raised space w<sup>th</sup> a Carpet. This
throne and Canopy and y<sup>e</sup> back with Stooles and Chaires
was Crimson and Gold Coullour’d ffigured velvet. Out of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>this I Came into a Large roome for people to wait in,
painted with black and white and gold—Description of
some ffights and men in armour. Thence into the Kings
Guard Chamber w<sup>ch</sup> is deckt as the Queens, the walls being
adorned w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> severall armes put in Exact order, only in y<sup>e</sup>
pillars or spaces here they hang the Bandaleers which holds
their powder. In the mantle piece there was noe difference,
but in y<sup>e</sup> middle was the starre and soe set about with y<sup>e</sup>
pistols and swords. Thence I descended Large staires of
stone, and soe through a Court back to y<sup>e</sup> walk of pillars,
and soe through the Large jron gate into the Courts one
without another all built round.</p>

<p class='c012'>Winsor town Lookes well, the streetes Large, the Market
Cross on stone pillars and a Large hall on the top; from
thence the streete runs along to y<sup>e</sup> Bridge over the
Thames and there you Enter Buckinghamshire and a
quarter of a mile off, tho’ jndeed there is building all along.
There is Eaton Colledge a good stone building Carved on
y<sup>e</sup> outside, its round a square. There is at the ffront a
Large schoole roome—400 schollars and 8 fellows w<sup>ch</sup> have
400 a piece yearely. Y<sup>e</sup> master has 1000<sup>£</sup>, he payes all the
ushers, in number seven; there is alsoe an under master for
the Little schollars, this was ffounded by King Edward the
Confessour and Endowed so richly by him, and on the same
ffoundation is the revenues of y<sup>e</sup> Cathedrall and y<sup>e</sup> poore
knights w<sup>ch</sup> goe in a peculiar black gown like fryers. All
their salleryes and y<sup>e</sup> repaire of the Cathedrall is taken Care
of by y<sup>e</sup> same ffoundation, w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Colledge, not but there is
a Little Chappel to y<sup>e</sup> Colledge w<sup>th</sup> in itself for Every dayes
prayers. The Chappel and schoole room takes up two sides
of the square, the two others is the Lodging for y<sup>e</sup> ffellows
and for y<sup>e</sup> schollars; then y<sup>e</sup> middle there is an arch w<sup>ch</sup>
Leads to y<sup>e</sup> Cloyster and soe into their kitchen and Cellars
which are very Convenient and high but pretty old. Just
by is the great Hall in w<sup>ch</sup> they eate, the schollars and
fellows and masters should eate with them. This is the
same ffoundation as Kings Colledge in Cambridge so y<sup>t</sup>
those schollers that are fitt to be removed to y<sup>e</sup> University
at y<sup>e</sup> Election are sped to Kings Colledge in Cambridge and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>so are advanced as they Can get friends into ffellowshipps
to Either. Ffrom Windsor I went to y<sup>e</sup> fferry 3 mile and
Rode in sight of y<sup>e</sup> Castle on this side w<sup>ch</sup> is all y<sup>e</sup> K: and
Q: appartments and Lookes very noble, y<sup>e</sup> walls round w<sup>th</sup>
y<sup>e</sup> battlements, and Gilt balls and other adornments. Here
I fferry over y<sup>e</sup> Thames and so went a nearer way which is
a private road Made for y<sup>e</sup> kings Coaches and so to Colebrooke
3 mile more. Thence to Houndslow-heath and so
to London 12 mile more, then I went to Bednallgreen 4
miles and home againe 4 mile more, and here ends my
Long journey this summer in w<sup>ch</sup> I had but 3 dayes of wet
except some refreshing showers sometymes, and I thinke y<sup>t</sup>
was not above 4 in all the way and it was in all above 1551
miles and many of them Long miles, in all which way and
tyme I desire w<sup>th</sup> thankfullness to own y<sup>e</sup> good providence
of God protecting me from all hazard or dangerous accident.</p>

<p class='c012'>It Cannot be thought amiss here to add some remarke on
y<sup>e</sup> metropolis of England. London whose scituation on so
noble a river as the Thames w<sup>ch</sup> Emptyes it at y<sup>e</sup> Boy of y<sup>e</sup>
Nore, being there joyned w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Medway another very fine
river alsoe, and falls there into y<sup>e</sup> sea w<sup>ch</sup> is about 30 miles
from London, and is an Ebbing flowing river as farre as
Sheen beyond London. This is very Comodious for shipps
w<sup>ch</sup> did Come up just to y<sup>e</sup> bridge, but from Carelessness y<sup>e</sup>
river is Choaked up, that obliges y<sup>e</sup> shipps to Come to an
anchor at Blackwall. All along this river are severall docks
for building shipps of y<sup>e</sup> biggest burden; six miles from the
town y<sup>e</sup> Last yeare was built y<sup>e</sup> Royal Souveraign w<sup>ch</sup> is
our greatest ship. London joyned w<sup>th</sup> Westminster, which
are two great Cittyes but now w<sup>th</sup> building so joyned it
makes up but one vast building with all its Subburbs, and has
in y<sup>e</sup> walls ninety seven Parishes, without y<sup>e</sup> walls 16 parishes,
15 subburbs, Surrey, Middlesex, 7 parishes in Westminster.</p>

<p class='c012'>London is y<sup>e</sup> Citty properly for trade, Westminster for y<sup>e</sup>
Court, y<sup>e</sup> first is divided into 24 wards to each which there
is an alderman, and themselves Consist of Common Council
men and all freemen of the Citty, and have power to Choose
these aldermen and make their own orders and to maintain
their own priviledges. All freemen or Livery men of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>Citty hath a Right to Choose their sherriffs of w<sup>ch</sup> Every
yeare there is two, one for Middlesex y<sup>e</sup> other y<sup>e</sup> Corporation,
but both are joyned and officiate together in all matters
of juries justice or Ceremonies, and to maintaine all Rights.
These freemen alsoe have their voyce in Choice of their
Lord Major w<sup>ch</sup> is done Every yeare with this Sollemnity,
the Sheriffs being Chosen and sworne at Mid summer, y<sup>e</sup>
Michaelmas after y<sup>e</sup> Lord Major is Chosen and sworne; y<sup>e</sup>
evening before which is Simon and Judes day is a feast
Called Calveshead feast. Next day y<sup>e</sup> old Lord Major
Comes to meete y<sup>e</sup> new one and w<sup>th</sup> him on his Left hand
is Conducted on horse back in all their gowns of scarlet
Cloth Lined w<sup>th</sup> ffurr; all y<sup>e</sup> aldermen in Like Robes only
differenc’d as their station, those of them w<sup>ch</sup> have been
Lord Majors weare a Gold Chaine Ever after, but those y<sup>t</sup>
have not passed y<sup>e</sup> Chaire weare none. Y<sup>e</sup> Lord Major is
allwayes one of y<sup>e</sup> aldermen and he has a great gold Chaine
round his neck, the Sheriffs also weare a gold Chaine round
their neck y<sup>t</sup> yeare. Thus on horseback they proceed two
and two w<sup>th</sup> all their officers. Y<sup>e</sup> Lord Major has his
Sword bearer w<sup>ch</sup> walkes before him w<sup>th</sup> the Sword in an
Embroyder’d Sheath he weares a Great velvet Cap of
Crimson, the bottom and y<sup>e</sup> top of ffurr or such Like standing
up Like a turbant or Great bowle in forme of a Great
open Pye, this is Called y<sup>e</sup> Cap of Maintenance. This is y<sup>e</sup>
Lord Majors Chiefe officer, he holds his place Dureing his
Life and has 1500 a yeare allowed him for his table w<sup>ch</sup> in
all things is as good as Lord Major’s and he Entertaines all
people at it, yet he himself must officiate at the Lord
Majors table to see all things in order and Comes in at sett
tymes accordingly to performe them and bring y<sup>e</sup> Lord
Majors Compliments to y<sup>e</sup> Campanyes. He thus walkes
before the Lord Mayor w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> water Bayliff beareing a Gold
Mace &amp;c. At Fleete ditch they Enter y<sup>e</sup> Barges w<sup>ch</sup> are all
very Curiously adorned and thus he is Conducted y<sup>e</sup> river
being full of Barges belonging to y<sup>e</sup> severall Companyes of
London, adorned with streamers and their armes and fine
musick, and have sack to drinke and Little Cakes as bigg as
a Crown piece. They Come to Westminster staires where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>they Land and are Conducted, the Lord Majors traines being
borne up as well y<sup>e</sup> old as new Lord Major, they Enter
Westminster Hall and are Conducted to y<sup>e</sup> severall Courts of
justice where there is severall Ceremonyes perform’d. The
new Lord Major is presented to y<sup>e</sup> King or those deputed to
act under him and then is sworne, all which being over they
are Conducted back to their Barges and soe to y<sup>e</sup> staires
they took barge, where they are received by some of y<sup>e</sup>
nobility deputed by the king who make some Little speech
of Compliment and Give y<sup>e</sup> Lord Major and aldermen a
treate of wine and sweet meates passant. They mount on
horseback and returne only y<sup>e</sup> new Lord Major takes y<sup>e</sup>
right hand and haveing by y<sup>e</sup> sheriffs invited y<sup>e</sup> King and
Court to dinner, w<sup>ch</sup> sometymes they accept but mostly
refuse, because it puts the Citty to a vast Charge; they
being then Conducted through y<sup>e</sup> Citty w<sup>th</sup> Greate acclamations
their own habits and trappings of their horses being
very fine, and they haveing all the Severall Companyes of
y<sup>e</sup> Citty w<sup>ch</sup> walke in their order and gowns w<sup>th</sup> pagents to
most or many of their Companyes, w<sup>ch</sup> are a sort of Stages
Covered and Carryed by men and on y<sup>e</sup> top many men and

and y<sup>t</sup> Company has y<sup>e</sup> precedency that yeare of all y<sup>e</sup> Companyes
Except y<sup>e</sup> mercers Company, w<sup>ch</sup> allwayes is the first

y<sup>t</sup> Company their pageant is a maiden queen on a throne
Crowned and with Royal Robes and scepter and most
richly dressed, w<sup>th</sup> Severall Ladyes dressed, her attendants,
all on y<sup>e</sup> same pageant and w<sup>th</sup> a Cannopy over her head
and drawn in an open Chariot w<sup>th</sup> 9 horses very finely
accouter’d and pages that Ride them all, w<sup>th</sup> plumes of

by y<sup>e</sup> Lord major to a dinner provided on purpose for her,
and soe many Rich Batchelors are appointed to Entertaine
her that is a ranck among y<sup>e</sup> freemen. She has her traine
bore up and is presented to Lady Majoris that salutes
her as doth the aldermens Ladyes, all w<sup>ch</sup> are Conducted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>in their Coaches to Guildhall. The new Lady Majoress
Richly habitted has her traine borne up, and Introduced by
one of the officers. The Sheriffs Ladyes Likewise weares
gold Chaines that yeare, the Lady majoress does wear it
ever after as doe all y<sup>e</sup> aldermens Ladyes whose husbands
have been Lord majors, and as I said before y<sup>e</sup> Lord
Majors must be aldermen and must have served as sheriffs
before, and allwayes y<sup>e</sup> king Confers Knighthood on the
person that is Chosen to be Sheriff unless he were a knight
before.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Guild Hall there are severall long tables plenty
fully ffurnished w<sup>th</sup> all sorts of varietyes suiteable to the

to their senioritye, after which they Retire into a Gallery
where is danceing the whole Evening.</p>

<p class='c012'>All this yeare Lord or Lady Majoress goe no where but
w<sup>th</sup> their officers to attend them, and y<sup>e</sup> old Lord Major
and Lady Majoress has their traines bore up to Guild Hall
and after dinner return without it. The whole affaires of y<sup>e</sup>
Citty are managed by y<sup>e</sup> Lord Major and Court of aldermen
and Common Councill men, he is obliged to take care
of justice and Right, he does during his yeare jnvite Each
Company w<sup>th</sup> all their Masters Wardens and officers twice—the
Last tyme all their wives alsoe—the Sherriffs doe y<sup>e</sup>
Like. Each person brings their Gift two, three Guinneas,
some more and according to their Gift at y<sup>e</sup> Last Entertainment
they have a silver spoon double Gilt, Either
weighing soe many ounces and soe many as they Give
Guinneas many tymes in the yeare: those y<sup>t</sup> would shew
particular respect will go dine w<sup>th</sup> them and bring presents
without haveing spoones.</p>

<p class='c012'>All offices falling vacant in the Majoralty acruee to
Lord Major to dispose off. There are 24 Companyes w<sup>ch</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>have each severall officers, as masters wardens &amp;c., and doe
meete to fix and maintaine their priviledges. They doe
walke at y<sup>e</sup> Lord Majors day and make sumptuous feasts at
Each hall appertaineing to their Comp<sup>y</sup> w<sup>ch</sup> is at y<sup>e</sup> Charge
of y<sup>e</sup> masters and wardens w<sup>ch</sup> are officers Chosen new
Every yeare. They have great stocks and Lands belonging
to their Companyes Common stock, and w<sup>ch</sup> does maintaine
schooles and Hospitalls and such Like w<sup>ch</sup> from tyme to
tyme are Encreased by severall Benefactors and Legacyes,
some of w<sup>ch</sup> are greate as in y<sup>e</sup> Mercers Company which
have Lands to a great value for such Ends. There are
severall feasts which Lord Major and Sherriffs are absolutely
obliged to make at their first Entrance into their offices,
two dayes following each other, and y<sup>e</sup> first day of y<sup>e</sup> terme
to all y<sup>e</sup> judges, and 3 dayes at Easter going to hear a
sermon at S<sup>t</sup> Brides Each day, and then to jnspect y<sup>e</sup>
severall Charityes and hospitalls y<sup>t</sup> all be kept in due order

King at all tymes to represent y<sup>e</sup> Publick affaires of y<sup>e</sup> Citty
and receive his orders, they alsoe officiate at y<sup>e</sup> proclaiming
any new King or Queen or to Declare peace or warr, w<sup>ch</sup> is
done in Greate solemnity by y<sup>e</sup> King at Arms and severall
of y<sup>e</sup> nobillity in Coaches or on horseback, and y<sup>e</sup> officers
of y<sup>e</sup> kings household.</p>

<p class='c012'>King Williams return after y<sup>e</sup> peace was Concluded w<sup>th</sup>
Ffrance and y<sup>e</sup> Confederates, the Kings Entry was in this
manner, y<sup>e</sup> Lord Major in Crimson velvet Gown w<sup>th</sup> a Long
traine on horseback attended by all his officers y<sup>e</sup> sword
bearer and water Baily very well dress’d. Y<sup>e</sup> Common
hunt was Clad in Green velvet, thus with all y<sup>e</sup> aldermen
in their scarlet gowns they proceeding to receive y<sup>e</sup> King
just at y<sup>e</sup> End of Southwark on y<sup>e</sup> borders of Kent, the
Lord Major Carrying a scepter w<sup>th</sup> a Crown of pearle on y<sup>e</sup>
top. Y<sup>e</sup> King was attended thus, ffirst of all his soldiers
and officers marched in Ranke, y<sup>e</sup> aldermen and Lord
Major and officers, then all y<sup>e</sup> nobillity in their Coaches, the
Bishops and judges, then y<sup>e</sup> first Coach of y<sup>e</sup> King w<sup>th</sup> his
household, then y<sup>e</sup> guards of his body, and then the Coach
where in y<sup>e</sup> King was, w<sup>ch</sup> was a very rich and Costly thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>all y<sup>e</sup> fring Rich Gold, y<sup>e</sup> Glass very Large, the Standards
and all outwork Like beaton Gold, drawn by 8 very fine
white horses with Massy Gold harness and trappings, the
Ffrench kings present to our king when the peace was
concluded, y<sup>e</sup> first article of w<sup>ch</sup> was owning King William
king of England. After the kings Coach a troope of guards
de Corps, then the third Coach of y<sup>e</sup> Kings w<sup>th</sup> his houshold,
and other Coaches with Severall officers of the houshold;
then as the king passed Southwarke the Baily
presented him his mace, he returned it with y<sup>e</sup> usuall
Ceremony and Grattification; then at y<sup>e</sup> bridge y<sup>e</sup> Lord
Major demands his place and y<sup>e</sup> sword, w<sup>ch</sup> is to March
as Capt<sup>n</sup> of y<sup>e</sup> Kings guards just Imediately before y<sup>e</sup>
kings own Coach, w<sup>ch</sup> accordingly was given him and he
returns the said scepter to y<sup>e</sup> proper officers who bear y<sup>t</sup>

same tyme y<sup>e</sup> water baily rides in the middle of y<sup>e</sup> guards
as their officer and is on horseback, two men Like pages
Leading it, soe is Lord Majors in this order: they proceeding
through the Citty w<sup>ch</sup> from y<sup>e</sup> Royal Exchange on
Each side had placed the traine bands of the Citty with
their officers, next them y<sup>e</sup> 24 companyes of y<sup>e</sup> Citty in
their order and marks of their Honour and priviledges, w<sup>ch</sup>
reached to y<sup>e</sup> Conduite in Cheapside, all w<sup>ch</sup> paid their
respective Homage and duty to y<sup>e</sup> King who receiv’d it
very kind and obligeingly, as he did y<sup>e</sup> Generall joy and
acclamations w<sup>ch</sup> proceeded from thousands which were
spectators. At Pauls Schoole y<sup>e</sup> Schollars made him a
speech and then he was Conducted to his own pallace at
Whitehall. But before I leave the Citty of London I
must describe its Building and treasure. Y<sup>e</sup> Government
as I said was Lord Major, aldermen, sherriffs, Recorder,
and Chamberlaine, and other officers as Common serjeant,
and other sergeants, sword Bearers, water Bayly, Common
Cryer, and y<sup>e</sup> town Clerke; all these with many other
officers has Considerable salleryes and Endure their Life,
Except y<sup>e</sup> Chamberlaine thats annually Chosen tho’ mostly
is in the same person againe. Those others are in the Lord
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Majors dispose and brings a greate advantage to him if any
dye in his Majoralty. There is alsoe many Considerable
perquisitts belonging to him to support y<sup>e</sup> honnour. The
Citty plaite is kept for Each, notwithstanding in y<sup>e</sup> year it
Costs them more many tymes than they Receive, and in
the whole I have had it from one y<sup>t</sup> had been at y<sup>e</sup> charge
said it was above 8000<sup>£</sup> in y<sup>e</sup> year.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is as I said great Publick Stock in the Citty by
which they have raised sumptuous Buildings, the Royal
Exchange for one, a Large space of Ground Enclosed round
w<sup>th</sup> Cloysters and open arches on w<sup>ch</sup> are built many walkes
of Shopps of all trades. Y<sup>e</sup> middle space below was
design’d and is used for the merchants to meete to Concert
their buisness and trade and bills, w<sup>ch</sup> is all open and on y<sup>e</sup>
top of these Piaza’s are y<sup>e</sup> Effigies in stone of most of our
kings and Queens since y<sup>e</sup> Conquest w<sup>ch</sup> were anoynted
Crowned heads, from whence this Exchange takes its name
Royal. In y<sup>e</sup> midst of it stands in stone work on a
Pedestal y<sup>e</sup> effigies of King Charles y<sup>e</sup> second railed in w<sup>th</sup>
Iron spikes. There is alsoe at y<sup>e</sup> Bridge a Great Monument
of stone worke as is y<sup>e</sup> Exchange; this is of a Great height
300 stepps up and on y<sup>e</sup> top gives y<sup>e</sup> view of y<sup>e</sup> whole town.
This was sett up in memory of Gods putting a Check to y<sup>e</sup>
Rageing flame w<sup>ch</sup> by y<sup>e</sup> plotts and Contrivance of y<sup>e</sup>
papists was Lighted. There is a Large Inscription on it
all round mentioning it, and alsoe of y<sup>e</sup> popish plott and
y<sup>e</sup> gun powd<sup>r</sup> treason and all by y<sup>e</sup> papists.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Bridge is a stately building all stone w<sup>th</sup> 18 arches
most of them bigg Enough to admit a Large Barge to pass,
its so broade that two Coaches drives a breast, and there is
on Each side houses and shopps just Like any Large streete
in y<sup>e</sup> Citty, of w<sup>ch</sup> there are many and well built, Even and
Lofty, most has 5 if not 6 degrees. Most of y<sup>e</sup> Halls
belonging to Each Company are Large and Magnificent
buildings, as alsoe y<sup>e</sup> Churches very fine and Lofty of stone
work. Ye Greate Cathedrall is S<sup>t</sup> Pauls w<sup>ch</sup> was a vast
building but burnt by fire, has since by y<sup>e</sup> Citty been built
up, or rather a tax on Coales w<sup>ch</sup> brings all to pay for it in
London. It now is almost ffinish’d and very magnificent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>the Quire w<sup>th</sup> Curious Carved work in wood, y<sup>e</sup> arch
Bishops seate and y<sup>e</sup> Bishop of Londons and Lord Majors
is very finely Carv’d and adorned, y<sup>e</sup> alter alsoe with velvet
and gold; on y<sup>e</sup> Right side is placed a Large Crimson
velvet Elbow chaire w<sup>ch</sup> is for the Dean. This is all
finished (w<sup>th</sup> a sweet organ) but y<sup>e</sup> body of y<sup>e</sup> Church
w<sup>ch</sup> is to be Closed on y<sup>e</sup> top w<sup>th</sup> a Large Cupilo is
not quite done. There was formerly in y<sup>e</sup> Citty severall
houses of y<sup>e</sup> Noblemens w<sup>th</sup> Large gardens and out
houses and Great attendances, but of Late are pulled down
and built into streetes and squares and Called by y<sup>e</sup>
names of y<sup>e</sup> noblemen, and this is the practise by
almost all even just to y<sup>e</sup> Court Excepting one or
two.</p>

<p class='c012'>Northumberland and Bedford house, and Lord Mountagues
house indeed has been new built and is very fine, one
roome in y<sup>e</sup> middle of y<sup>e</sup> building is of a surpriseing height
Curiously painted and very Large, yet soe Contrived y<sup>t</sup>
speake very Low to y<sup>e</sup> wall or wanscoate in one Corner and
it should be heard w<sup>th</sup> advantage in y<sup>e</sup> very opposite Corner
aCross—this I heard Myself. And this Leads me to y<sup>e</sup>
Citty of Westminster in w<sup>ch</sup> are many of these noblemens
houses built into very fine squares. Y<sup>e</sup> kings pallace was a
most magnificent building all of freestone, w<sup>th</sup> appartments
suiteable to y<sup>e</sup> Court of a King, in w<sup>ch</sup> was a Large roome
Called the Banqueting-roome w<sup>ch</sup> was fitted for and used in
all Publick solemnityes and audiences of ambassadours &amp;c.
This is y<sup>e</sup> only thing Left of y<sup>e</sup> vast building which by
accident or Carelessness, if not designe, has Laid it in ashes
together w<sup>th</sup> Exceeding Rich furniture of antiquity, as alsoe
y<sup>e</sup> greate and good Queen Mary’s Closet and Curious
treasures. This has all along y<sup>e</sup> prospect of y<sup>e</sup> Thames on
one side and a Large parke on y<sup>e</sup> other, walled in, which is
full of very fine walkes and rowes of trees, ponds and
Curious birds Deer, and some fine Cows. In this parke
stands another pallace S<sup>t</sup> James, w<sup>ch</sup> is very well and was
built for some of y<sup>e</sup> Royal Familly as y<sup>e</sup> Duke of Yorke or
Prince of Wales. There is at Whitehall in y<sup>e</sup> privy Garden
a Large pond w<sup>th</sup> a spout of water of a vast height. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of S<sup>t</sup> James is Little but daily building adding may make
it greate.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is alsoe one Nobleman’s house, is this Parke
House w<sup>ch</sup> is a very Curious Building. Just by this parke
you Enter another Much Larger, Hide-parke, w<sup>ch</sup> is for
Rideing on horseback but mostly for y<sup>e</sup> Coaches, there
being a ring railed in round w<sup>ch</sup> a Gravel way y<sup>t</sup> would
admitt of twelve if not more rowes of Coaches, w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup>
Gentry to take y<sup>e</sup> aire and see each other Comes and drives
round and round; one row going Contrary to each other
affords a pleaseing diversion. The rest of y<sup>e</sup> parke is green
and full of deer, there are Large ponds w<sup>th</sup> fish and fowle.
Y<sup>e</sup> whole Length of this parke there is a high Causey of a
good breadth, 3 Coaches may pass and on Each side are
Rowes of posts on w<sup>ch</sup> are Glasses—Cases for Lamps w<sup>ch</sup>
are Lighted in y<sup>e</sup> Evening and appeares very fine as well
as safe for y<sup>e</sup> passenger. This is only a private roade y<sup>e</sup>
king had w<sup>ch</sup> reaches to Kensington, where for aire our
Great King W<sup>m</sup> bought a house and filled it for a Retirement
w<sup>th</sup> pretty gardens. Besides these y<sup>e</sup> king has a
pallace in y<sup>e</sup> Strand w<sup>th</sup> fine gardens all to y<sup>e</sup> Thames
river, this appertaines to y<sup>e</sup> Queen Dowager while she
Lives. In this place was y<sup>t</sup> cruel Barbarous Murder of
S<sup>r</sup> Edmund Berry Godfrey by y<sup>e</sup> papists. Westminster is
remarkable for haveing in it y<sup>e</sup> ancient Large abbey w<sup>ch</sup> is
a most magnificent Building of stone finely Graved, and
within is adorned w<sup>th</sup> severall monuments of our Kings and
Queens and great personages.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Harry y<sup>e</sup> sevenths Chapple Layes our Great and good
as well as Ever Glorious King William, and Queen Mary

<p class='c012'>At y<sup>e</sup> Death of a Prince which I have been a mournfull

<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>King William and queen Marys, the Queen Dying before

Rich gold fring, y<sup>e</sup> middle being y<sup>e</sup> armes of England
Curiously painted and Gilt, y<sup>e</sup> head piece Embroyder’d
Richly w<sup>th</sup> a Crown and Cyphers of her name, a Cusheon

A Pall on all of a very Rich tissue of gold and silver,

full of Large wax tapers, and at y<sup>e</sup> 4 Corners of the bed
stood 4 of y<sup>e</sup> Ladyes of y<sup>e</sup> bed Chamber—Countesses—w<sup>th</sup>

there attended four of y<sup>e</sup> Maids of honnour all in vailes, and
y<sup>e</sup> Gentlemen of the bed Chamber, pages in another roome

only soe for that day, and he goes just before the Led horse.
The pages also Lead all y<sup>e</sup> horses that draws y<sup>e</sup> Chariot,

bore the Gold Spurrs, another Lord with y<sup>e</sup> Scepter Royal,
3 other Lords following w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> sword of justice, y<sup>e</sup> Curtana
sword of mercy, and another poynted sword, next which
S<sup>r</sup> Garter King at armes between my Lord Major and the
usher of y<sup>e</sup> black Rod. These Heraulds dress in Coates
full of y<sup>e</sup> Kings armes all about with Gildings, and hang
short w<sup>th</sup> Long sleeves and sleeves hanging behind alsoe.
Next y<sup>e</sup> Lord High Chamberlaine single, then next an
Earle beares y<sup>e</sup> sword of State between y<sup>e</sup> Earle Marshall
and y<sup>e</sup> Lord high Constable, made for y<sup>t</sup> Dayes Solemnity.
Next goes an Earle Beareing y<sup>e</sup> Scepter of y<sup>e</sup> Dove,
next y<sup>t</sup> a Duke Carrying y<sup>e</sup> Globe orb, next went a Duke
w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Crown w<sup>ch</sup> must be Lord High Steward for that
dayes Solemnity, next went a Bishop w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> Bible between
two other Bishops y<sup>t</sup> Carryed y<sup>e</sup> pattent and y<sup>e</sup> Challice
w<sup>ch</sup> Last appertaines to y<sup>e</sup> Dean of Westminster. Next
this the Cannopys and in Case there is a King then his
Consort goes before him in this manner under a Cannopy
of Cloth of Gold borne up by 8 Barrons of y<sup>e</sup> Cinque ports,
and is supported by two Bishops, and her Coronet or
Crown is alsoe Carryed by a Lord before, and alsoe a silver
Rod by another Lord, w<sup>ch</sup> when she returns she holds in
one hand and the Little scepter. Her traine is bore up
by y<sup>e</sup> first Duchess of y<sup>e</sup> Realme assisted by 4 maiden
Daughters of Earles and her Robes ought to be only
Crimson velvet, but King James’s Queen would have
purple, but never Changes them as doth a Queen that is
Regent in her self y<sup>e</sup> Principal, as Queen Ann and her
sister Queen Mary joinct in y<sup>e</sup> throne w<sup>th</sup> King William.
All w<sup>ch</sup> in some things makes a Difference as shall show,
for y<sup>e</sup> Queen Consort as King James’s queen was not
anoynted nor sworne unless as a subject to y<sup>e</sup> King and
walked thus before him, after which y<sup>e</sup> King Came under
another Cannopy of gold tissue supported by 8 more of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>y<sup>e</sup> Barrons of the Cinque-ports; he leaned on two Bishops,
his traine borne up by the Lord w<sup>ch</sup> is Master of his robes
assisted by four Lords sonns. These Cannopyes have
silver staves for Each person to hold them up by. In y<sup>e</sup>
Case of King William and Queen Mary that were set
joynctly on the throne anoynted both and sworne by y<sup>e</sup>
Coronation oath, they Likewise walked both under one of
these Canopyes made very Large supported by y<sup>e</sup> 16
Barrons, and on y<sup>e</sup> outside of Each went a Bishop on
whome they Leaned, Leading Each other; and their
traines were bore, the Kings by y<sup>e</sup> Lord w<sup>ch</sup> is master of
y<sup>e</sup> Robes, the Queen by y<sup>e</sup> first Dutchess and young Ladies.
And soe their throne was Entire two seates and their
Cannopyes one at y<sup>e</sup> table, but now as in Case of our
present Majesty Queen Ann I saw her thus; her Cannopy
was Large bore by y<sup>e</sup> sixteen, and she because of Lameness
of y<sup>e</sup> Gout had an Elbow Chaire of Crimson velvet
w<sup>th</sup> a Low back, by w<sup>ch</sup> meanes her mantle and Robe was
Cast over it and bore by the Lord Master of y<sup>e</sup> Robes and
y<sup>e</sup> first Dutchess, w<sup>th</sup> 4 maiden Ladies, Earles Daughters on
Each side Richly Dress’d in Cloth of Gold or Silver, Laced,
w<sup>th</sup> Long traines, Richly Dressed in fine Linnen, and
jewells in their hair, and Embroider’d on their Gowns.
The Queens traine was 6 yards Long, the Mantle suitable
of Crimson velvet with Earmine as y<sup>e</sup> other of y<sup>e</sup> nobility,
only the rowes of powdering Exceeded, being six rowes of
powdering. Her Robe under was of Gold tissue, very Rich
Embroydery of jewellry about it, her peticoate the same of
Gold tissue w<sup>th</sup> gold and silver lace, between Rowes of
Diamonds Embroyder’d, her Linnen fine. The Queen
being principall of the order of y<sup>e</sup> Garter had a row of
Gold S S about her shoulders, y<sup>e</sup> Georges w<sup>ch</sup> are allwayes
set with Diamonds and tyed with a blew Ribon. Her
head was well dress’d w<sup>th</sup> Diamonds mixed in y<sup>e</sup> haire
w<sup>ch</sup> at y<sup>e</sup> Least motion Brill’d and flamed. She wore a
Crimson velvet Cap with Earmine under y<sup>e</sup> Circlet, w<sup>ch</sup> was
set with Diamonds, and on the middle a sprig of Diamonds
drops transparent hung in form of a plume of feathers, for
this Cap is y<sup>e</sup> Prince of Wales’s Cap w<sup>ch</sup> till after y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>Coronation that makes them Legall king and queen—they
weare. Thus to y<sup>e</sup> quire doore she Came, then Leaveing
y<sup>e</sup> Cannopy—(y<sup>e</sup> Chaire she Left at y<sup>e</sup> Abby doore—) she
is conducted to y<sup>e</sup> Alter which was finely deck’d w<sup>th</sup> Gold
tissue Carpet and fine Linnen, on the top all y<sup>e</sup> plaite of y<sup>e</sup>
abby sett, y<sup>e</sup> velvet Cushions to place y<sup>e</sup> Crown and all y<sup>e</sup>
regallias on. She made her offering at y<sup>e</sup> Alter, a pound
weight or wedge of gold, here the Dean of Westminster
and y<sup>e</sup> prebends which assists the Arch-Bishop in the
Cerimonyes are arrayed in very Rich Coapes and Mitres,
black velvet Embroyder’d w<sup>th</sup> gold Starrs, or Else tissue of
gold and silver. Then the Littany and prayers are sung
and repeated by two Bishops w<sup>th</sup> a small organ, then the
Queen being seated on a green velvet Chaire faceing the
pulpit attends y<sup>e</sup> words of y<sup>e</sup> sermon w<sup>ch</sup> was by y<sup>e</sup> arch-Bishop
of York, w<sup>ch</sup> being ended y<sup>e</sup> Queen arose and
returned thanks for y<sup>e</sup> Arch-bishops Sermon, is shewed to
y<sup>e</sup> people by saying a form, Will you take this to be your
Souveraigne to be over you? thus I saw the Queen turn
her face to y<sup>e</sup> four sides of y<sup>e</sup> Church, then the Coronation
oath is repeated to her, w<sup>ch</sup> she distinctly answered each
article, which oath is very Large in three articles, relateing
to all priviledges of y<sup>e</sup> Church and State to which she
promised to be the security and to maintaine all to us.
Then she kiss’d y<sup>e</sup> Bible, then a Bible was presented to her
to maintaine y<sup>e</sup> true Protestant religion. Then she being
on a Little throne by the alter, Cover’d all w<sup>th</sup> Cloth of
Gold, she has y<sup>e</sup> spurrs of gold brought her and they toutch
her heele, then the sword of state is presented her which
she offers up on the alter, w<sup>ch</sup> a Lord appoynted for it
redeemes y<sup>e</sup> sword for 100 shillings, and draws it out and
beares it naked all y<sup>e</sup> day. After the other swords are
brought and presented her w<sup>ch</sup> she delivers to y<sup>e</sup> severall
officers, then the ring is put on her finger to witness she is
married to the Kingdom, then the orb I saw brought and
presented to her and y<sup>e</sup> Scepters. Then she was anoynted
in this manner; there was a Cloth of silver twilight Embroyder’d,
held a Little shaddowing over her head. I saw
y<sup>e</sup> Bishop bring y<sup>e</sup> oyle on a spoone soe annoynted y<sup>e</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>palmes of her hands, her breast and her forehead, Last of
all y<sup>e</sup> top of her head, haveing taken off y<sup>e</sup> prince of
Wales’s Cap and y<sup>e</sup> haire being Cutt off Close at y<sup>e</sup> top y<sup>e</sup>
oyle was poured on and with a fine Cloth all Dryed againe.
Then Last of all y<sup>e</sup> arch Bishops held the Crown over her
head w<sup>ch</sup> Crown was made on purpose for this Cerimony
vastly Rich in Diamonds, y<sup>e</sup> borders and y<sup>e</sup> Globe part very
thick sett w<sup>th</sup> vast diamonds, y<sup>e</sup> Cross on y<sup>e</sup> top with all
diamonds w<sup>ch</sup> flamed at y<sup>e</sup> Least motion, this is worth a
vast summe, but being made for this Cerimony and pulled
to pieces againe, its only soe much for the hire of such
Jewells that made it. This I saw was fix’d on y<sup>e</sup> Queens
head w<sup>th</sup> Huzza’s and sound of Drumms trumpets and
gunns, and at the same tyme all y<sup>e</sup> peeres and peeresses
put on their Coronets on their heads. There are divers
forms of speech that belong to each Cerimony. Y<sup>e</sup> Queen
after this goes to y<sup>e</sup> alter and there I saw her receive the
Sacrament, I saw the deane bring her y<sup>e</sup> bread and wine.
Then she is Conducted with her Crown on, her Globe and
Scepter in her hand and seated on y<sup>e</sup> Royal throne of y<sup>e</sup>
Kingdom w<sup>ch</sup> is of gold finely wrought, high back and armes
set on a theatre of severall steps, assent rises on four sides
to it. She being thus seated is followed w<sup>th</sup> a second
Huzza and sound of drums and trumpets and Gunns, then
all y<sup>e</sup> Lords and Bishops pay their homage to her; the
Eldest of Each ranke swears fidelity to her in his own
name and in y<sup>e</sup> name of all of his ranck. They all singly
come and touch her Crown and some kiss her Right
Cheeke—they make all do soe,—she kisses the Bishops.
All this while anthems are sung and the Medals are Cast
about by the treasurer of y<sup>e</sup> houshold, after w<sup>ch</sup> the Queen
arose and went and made her second offering, sate down
on the throne on w<sup>ch</sup> she was annoynted and Crown’d.
After, an anthem is sung proper for the tyme, after w<sup>ch</sup> the
Queen retired into King Edwards Chappel to private
prayer, w<sup>ch</sup> being ended and her Crimson velvet mantle
being taken off and one of purple velvet made just y<sup>e</sup> same
put on, in y<sup>e</sup> same manner they returned Each one in his
station, only the Lords y<sup>t</sup> Carryed the Regalias now tooke
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>their places as peers with y<sup>e</sup> rest, y<sup>e</sup> Queen walked to y<sup>e</sup>
doore of y<sup>e</sup> abby w<sup>th</sup> obligeing Lookes and bows to all y<sup>t</sup>
Saluted her and were spectatours, w<sup>ch</sup> were prodigious
numbers in Scaffolds built in the Abbey and all the streetes
on each side reaching to Westminster hall, where the Queen
againe quitted her Chaire w<sup>ch</sup> was Carryed by four men,
the whole procession being both going and comeing
attended by y<sup>e</sup> gentlemen pensioners Clad in Scarlet Cloth
w<sup>th</sup> gold Lace, Holding halberds w<sup>th</sup> gold tops Like pick-axes.
These make a Lane for the queen to pass and
follow two and two, next them y<sup>e</sup> groomes of the bed
Chamber, then the Captaine of y<sup>e</sup> guards went between y<sup>e</sup>
Captaine of y<sup>e</sup> pensioners band and the Captain of y<sup>e</sup>
yeaumen, and were attended by their officers and yeamen.</p>

<p class='c012'>The queen being Come up to her table w<sup>ch</sup> was a great
rise of stepps she was seated on her throne w<sup>ch</sup> was under a
fine Cannopy. When King James was Crown’d he sate soe:
at his Left hand sate his Queen under another Cannopy,
but King William and Queen Mary being both principalls
sate under one Large Cannopy on one Large throne, but
our present Queen should have sate alone as she did in the
upper End under y<sup>e</sup> Cannopy, but she sent and did invite
Prince George her Consort to dine with her. So he Came
and at her request tooke his seate at her Left hand without
the Cannopy. The first Course was served just before the
Queen Came in, She being ushered in by the Earle Marshall,
Lord High Steward, and Lord high Chamberlaine on horseback,
their horses being finely dress’d and managed, and the
Cookes Came up with their point aprons and towells about
their shoulders of poynt; after w<sup>ch</sup> Comes up the Lord high
steward againe on horseback, with the other two Lords, and
acquaints the king or queen there is their Champion without
ready to Encounter or Combate with any that should
pretend to dispute, after w<sup>ch</sup> he is Conducted in on horseback
by the Earle Marshall and y<sup>e</sup> Lord high steward, and
they Come up to the stepps of the throne, and there the
Champion all dress’d in armour Cap-a-pe and declares his
readyness to Combate w<sup>th</sup> any that should oppose the Right
of their Majestyes, and there upon throws down his guantlet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>w<sup>ch</sup> is giving Challenge, after w<sup>ch</sup> the King or Queen drinks
to him in a Gold Cup w<sup>th</sup> a Cover, y<sup>e</sup> same w<sup>ch</sup> is Carryed
to y<sup>e</sup> Champion and he drinks, and then he retires back and
Carrys it away being his Due as is the best horse in the
kings stable, y<sup>e</sup> best suite of armour in y<sup>e</sup> armory. This
belongs to S<sup>r</sup> John Dimmocks familly y<sup>t</sup> hath a yearly salery
from the Crown. My Lord Major here officiates as y<sup>e</sup>
kings Butler, and hath for a Reward such another Cup of
gold Covered and thus the Ceremony Ends and they all
retire. Westminster Hall is as full of spectatours sitting on
scaffolds on Each side, under w<sup>ch</sup> are severall Long tables
spread and full of all varietyes prepared for the Lords and
Ladies, others for the judges, aldermen &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c012'>When there is a Rideing Coronation they proceed on from
y<sup>e</sup> abbey when a king is Crowned, all on horseback thro’ y<sup>e</sup>
Citty in y<sup>e</sup> same order as at the Entry at y<sup>e</sup> peace, quite to
y<sup>e</sup> Tower all richly dress’d and their horses w<sup>th</sup> fine trappings,
Led on both sides by Each Lords pages, and when its a
King only, then only y<sup>e</sup> Lords attend as in y<sup>e</sup> Coronation of
King Charles the second, but at Queen Elizabeths the Ladies
alsoe attended to y<sup>e</sup> Tower which is at the utmost extremity
of y<sup>e</sup> Citty of London, where the Governour presents the
King with y<sup>e</sup> Keyes which he returns againe and after some
other Cerimonyes and makeing some Knights of y<sup>e</sup> Bath
Either six or Eight I Cannot tell which. These are an
order that prefferr such a knight above all other knights,
but is not so high as a Barronet and it alsoe expires at their
Death descending not to y<sup>e</sup> son; they wear a scarlet Ribon
round their shoulder Like a belt: then they all return back
to the pallace; Usually the rideing Coronation holds two
dayes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The tower is built just by y<sup>e</sup> Thames, thereon many
gunns are placed all round, its built of free stone, four
towers. In one is y<sup>e</sup> amunition and powder, Called y<sup>e</sup> white
tower, w<sup>ch</sup> is kept very secure w<sup>th</sup> 6 keyes w<sup>ch</sup> are kept by
six persons. In another part the Coynage is where they
refine, melt, form, stamp and Engrave all y<sup>e</sup> money w<sup>ch</sup> is
managed by severall over w<sup>ch</sup> there is y<sup>e</sup> Comptroler of
y<sup>e</sup> mint. In another part is kept severall Lyons w<sup>ch</sup> are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>named by y<sup>e</sup> names of y<sup>e</sup> kings, and it has been observ’d
that when a king has dyed y<sup>e</sup> Lion of y<sup>e</sup> name has alsoe
dyed.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are also other strange Creatures kept there, Leopards,
Eagles &amp;c &amp;c w<sup>ch</sup> have been brought from forreign parts.
In another place is kept the Crowns and all y<sup>e</sup> Regalias,
as orb, scepters, swords. The Crown that is made on
purpose to Crown a prince is pulled to pieces againe and
they only reserve an old large Crown of King Harry y<sup>e</sup>
seventh in form of a Ducall Coronet, and y<sup>e</sup> Crown w<sup>ch</sup> is
used for the passing of bills, of w<sup>ch</sup> here after. This hath
Large pearles on y<sup>e</sup> Cross and an Emerauld on y<sup>e</sup> top of y<sup>e</sup>
head w<sup>ch</sup> Closes the bands w<sup>ch</sup> goes every way of y<sup>e</sup> sides to
y<sup>e</sup> round frame full of Diamonds and Saphyr’s and Rubies
w<sup>ch</sup> y<sup>e</sup> frame at y<sup>e</sup> bottom is also enchased with. This
Large Emerauld is as bigg as an Egg all transparent and
well Cut: the Globe is alsoe sett w<sup>th</sup> diamonds representing
y<sup>e</sup> Lines on the Celestial Globe. The middle or body of y<sup>e</sup>
Tower is full of armour of all sorts and placed in Each
roome w<sup>th</sup> great Curiosity Like a ffurniture on y<sup>e</sup> walls and
kept very bright and fine. And now I shall return to y<sup>e</sup>
Hall att Westminster where are all y<sup>e</sup> Courts of justice
kept. There are severall parts out of y<sup>e</sup> hall for y<sup>e</sup> Court of
y<sup>e</sup> Kings Bench for tryal of all Causes by jurys, Grand
juryes and petty jurys, to manage w<sup>ch</sup> there is a Lord Chief
Justice and three other Judges his assistants, where matters
are heard by Councellors, attornys and solicitors to plead y<sup>e</sup>
Cause in the Court. All these formerly were but few in
number when buisness was not delayed but brought to
a quick jssue and persons had matters decided quicker,
but now they are increased extreamely and Consequently
buisness Lengthened out for their profit. There is alsoe
another Court of y<sup>e</sup> Common pleas to w<sup>ch</sup> is another
Chiefe Justice, the first is Call’d the Lord Chiefe Justice of
the Kings Bench Court, y<sup>e</sup> other the Lord Chiefe Justice of
y<sup>e</sup> Common pleas—he hath alsoe three Judges assistants.
This Court is in something the same nature managed as
y<sup>e</sup> former, only that matters of Life and death are not
here tryed or determined, that belongs to y<sup>e</sup> Kings Bench.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>There is alsoe the Exchequer Chamber which is another
Court and managed by a Lord Chiefe Baron and 3 other
Barrons assistants, w<sup>ch</sup> are all judges, and all first sergeants
and in this manner are fitted, having been Entred at such
an age into any of y<sup>e</sup> jnns of Court of w<sup>ch</sup> there are many in
y<sup>e</sup> town, Lincolns-inn, Grays-inn, Ffurnifulls-inn, Clemens-jnn,
Cliffords-inn and others. The Temples Likewise are
such where they are students in the Law and goe to hear
Causes and are trained up in that Learning w<sup>ch</sup> is grounded
on our Laws, the Magna Charta Law of the whole kingdom
by w<sup>ch</sup> all matters are or may be decided. After soe many
yeares studdy and being thus Entred they are Called to y<sup>e</sup>
barr—y<sup>t</sup> is to plead as Councellors and Barristers in these
Courts, and out of such that have been thus Barristers many
yeares they Commence serjeants, and are made in this
manner the first day of a terme. They walk two and two
in their Gowns from y<sup>e</sup> Temple to Westminster Hall where
Each that is designed for serjeants stand with their Back to
y<sup>e</sup> Barr of the Court at a Little distance, y<sup>e</sup> puny judge on
the Bench sayes to the Lord Chief Justice, my Lord I think
I spye a Brother; the Lord Chief Justice replies truly
Brother I thinke its soe indeed, send and bring him up to
be examined whether capable or well quallify’d; w<sup>ch</sup> is done
and after severall questions he is sworn and has a Coiffe put
on his head, which is a black satten Cap w<sup>th</sup> a white Lace
or Edge round y<sup>e</sup> bottom and thus he is received into their
number and soe returned. They have a feast and pay their
fees which is considerable all to maintain the Court out of
such as are sergeants. The king makes judges and gives
them salleryes; all the judges doe weare scarlet robes
Lined with furr. These twelve judges sitt in the House of
Lords on wooll packs, not as peers but as Councellors to
informe the house of what is their former Laws, and to
decide matters that Come before them if relating to the Law,
and soe are only their officers and Cannot put on their Caps
without permission of y<sup>e</sup> Lords. There is alsoe another
Court for justice w<sup>ch</sup> is Called the Court of Equity or
Chancery. The other Courts properly Judges of the matters
of Right by Law this as to the Equitty of it, w<sup>ch</sup> is managed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>by a Lord Chancellor or a Lord Keeper, w<sup>ch</sup> is not in soe
high a station nor at so vast expence, but answers the Ends
of the other as to the Buissness—is Called Lord Keeper
because he keepes the great seale of England w<sup>ch</sup> makes all
authentick that passes it. This sometymes is managed in
Commision by three, but many tymes by one single person,
he allwayes sitts in the house of Lords alsoe and is y<sup>e</sup>
speaker of y<sup>e</sup> house of Lords. Under him there is the
Master of the Roles w<sup>ch</sup> is his deputy and in the others
absence acts in the Court as Chiefe. This Court keeps all
the Records and statutes, there are two registers belongs to
it with six masters which are alsoe the under justices, and
six Clerks w<sup>ch</sup> have all their Respective offices and Enter all
things. Under them is the 60 Clerks and other under
writers. This formerly was the best Court to relieve the
subject but now is as Corrupt as any and as dilatory. The
Causes in the Chancery are heard and Refferr’d to some of
the masters and they report the matter againe, and soe from
the notion of this being a Court of Equitty and so gives
Liberty for persons to make all the allegation and reasons
in their Cause, which much delayes y<sup>e</sup> dispatch, which
formerly was of a very good advantage to prevent a huddling
up a Cause without allowing tyme for y<sup>e</sup> partys to produce
their evidences or Right, but now by that meanes is soe ill
managed that it admitts of heareing, Re-heareing over and
over on the Least motion of y<sup>e</sup> Contrary party, that will
pretend to offer new reason matter for delaying judgment,
that by this it accrues great advantage to y<sup>e</sup> Lawyers that
have all their fees each motion and may be so Continued
many yeares to sometyme y<sup>e</sup> ruin of the Plaintiffs and
deffendants. A small gratuiety obteine an order to delay
till the next terme and so to another.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are four termes in a yeare, one at Easter, another
at Midsumer, and at Michaelmas, and Candle-mass, at
which tymes these Courts of justice are open for tryal of y<sup>e</sup>
Causes belonging to their Courts, and holds a fortnight or
more, one three weekes, another a month, one 5 weekes;
but there are sealeing dayes w<sup>ch</sup> hold much Longer and
this between Easter and Midsumer terme joyns the tymes.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>Y<sup>e</sup> Last terme is the shortest but the seales hold Longer.
After this is the Long vacation being the heate of the
weather and tyme of harvest in which tyme alsoe are the
assizes in all the Countys in England, for at y<sup>e</sup> End of the
Midsummer terme y<sup>e</sup> Judges takes y<sup>e</sup> Circuites assigned
Each, usual the Lord Chiefe Justice of England w<sup>ch</sup> is of y<sup>e</sup>
Kings Bench Chuses the home Circuit w<sup>ch</sup> is the County
adjacent all about London, w<sup>ch</sup> is a Less fatigue and more
Easily perform’d. Two judges must goe in Each Circuite
and in all places the one sitts on the Bench of Life and
Death, y<sup>e</sup> other on buisness de-nise-prises, and soe they
exchange in all the places they Come, y<sup>e</sup> judge y<sup>t</sup> was on
the Life and death at one County, in the next takes y<sup>e</sup> barr
of the nais prisse and so on. There is one Called the
Northern Circuit w<sup>ch</sup> is a Long one and takes in Wales;
there is the Western Circuite alsoe: this takes up 6 of y<sup>e</sup> 12
judges and Barrons.</p>

<p class='c012'>But all this while there must be two at Least Left in
London to heare and attend y<sup>e</sup> sessions of y<sup>e</sup> Old Bayly
which is kept once a month both of Life and death and
Common pleas.</p>

<p class='c012'>In all these sessions at y<sup>e</sup> Old Bayly y<sup>e</sup> Lord Major is
the judge and sitts as such, but Leaves the management of
the Law to the Chiefe justice or Judges which ought to be
two. There is the Recorder of y<sup>e</sup> Citty also another justice
who after y<sup>e</sup> judge has summon’d the Evidence does alsoe
summ it up, and this is in all the tryals at the Kings
Bench, alsoe here the sword Bearer is a officer, and
Common Cryer, and alsoe the two Sherriffs attends, they
impanell the Jury and their office is so necessary y<sup>t</sup> at the
death of a Sherriff as happened Last yeare the Buissness of
the terme happening then stood still till another was Chosen
and sworne.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Recorder of the Citty is allwayes knighted and soe
is the Chamberlaine of the Citty. Now in the assizes in all
the Countyes of England the sherriff of the County Comes
to the Edge of the County and Receives y<sup>e</sup> judges from the
hand of the sherriff of y<sup>e</sup> next County and Conducts him to
y<sup>e</sup> County town attended w<sup>th</sup> the Gentry, and there is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>Large house in the town hired for that tyme for the judge,
and all the sherriffs officers attends him and he in person;
alsoe he sends the judge a present y<sup>e</sup> first night of meate
and wine and gives him one dinner. Its usual that the
Judges are Entertained most of the tyme by the Bishop
Major and best Gentlemen, its seldom they stay more than a
weeke in a place unless they have a great deale of Buisness
or that one of the judges should be sick so y<sup>t</sup> y<sup>e</sup> other must
supply both barrs one after another. There are Lawyers
that allwayes do follow the judges, some serjeant which
people make use of in their Causes and joyne w<sup>th</sup> them
some of their own Country Lawyers. There are two of
these assizes in a year, the other is in the winter, besides
which in Each County they have quarterly sessions to w<sup>ch</sup>
all Constables of that precinct repaires, and the titheing
men w<sup>th</sup> their presentments and Complaints to punish and
relieve in petty matters w<sup>ch</sup> the Justice of the peace are
judges off, and if they have a matter before them beyond
their decision they bind them over to the asizes and there
to prosecute them. The manner of Criminalls punishment
after Condemnation, w<sup>ch</sup> if it be for fellony or treason their
Condemnation of the first is to be hanged, and they are drawn
in a Cart from their prisons where they had been Confined
all the tyme after they were taken, I say they are drawn in
a Cart with their Coffin tyed to them and halters about
their necks, there is alsoe a Divine with them that is
allwayes appointed to be with them in the prison to prepare
them for their death by makeing them sencible of their
Crimes and all their sins, and to Confess and repent of
them. These do accompany them to the place of Execution
w<sup>ch</sup> is generally through the Citty to a place appoynted
for it Called Tijburn. there after they have prayed and
spoken to the people the minister does Exhort them to
repent and to forgive all the world, the Executioner then
desires him to pardon him and so the halter is put on and
he is Cast off, being hung on a Gibbet till dead, then Cut
down and buried unless it be for murder; then usually his
body is hung up in Chaines at a Cross high road in view of
all, to deterre others. For high treason they are drawn in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>a sledge to their Execution without any Coffin, for their
Condemnation when hang’d to be taken down before quite
dead and to be opened. They take out their heart and
say this is the heart of a traytor, and so his body is Cutt in
quarters and hung up on the top of the Great gates of the
Citty which are the places of their prison, some gate
houses for debters, others for fellons and traytors. In Case
its a woman which is a traytor then she is Condemned to
be burnt. All at their Execution have Liberty to speake,
and in Case they are sencible of and repent of their Crimes
they do declare it and bewaile it and warne others from
doing the Like, but if they are hard’nd they persist in
denying it to the Last. Now as I said y<sup>e</sup> Law Condemns
all thus to be Executed, but if it be great persons they
obtaine Leave of y<sup>e</sup> king they may be beheaded, which is
done on a scaffold Erected on purpose in manner of a
stage, and the persons brought in Coaches with Ministers
do as the former; then when they have ended their prayers
and speech they Lay down their head on a block and
stretch out their bodies. The Executioner strikes off their
heads with an ax or sword made on purpose and if it be
for treason take the head and hold it up saying this is
the head of a traytor; and such Great persons, Especially
those that Can pay well for it, have their heads sewed on
againe and so buried. The Prison in London for great
persons is the Tower where are appartments for y<sup>t</sup> purpose.
There is in all the County towns Jailes maintained at
the publick Charge, besides which there are houses for
Correction of Lesser faults, as Bridewell, to Correct Lazy
and Idle persons and to set them to work, and alsoe stocks
and pillorys to punish them for their Lesser faults. The
Pilory jndeed is to punish perjur’d persons, which is a
greate Crime. There is alsoe whipping, some at a Carts
taile, and for some Crimes they are burnt in the hand or
Cheeke as a brand of their Evil, and if found againe to
transgress, y<sup>t</sup> marke serves as a greater witness to their
Condemnation. Some alsoe are Banish’d out of y<sup>e</sup> kings
dominions dureing Life and should such return they must
be executed without any other tryal; under which we may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>speake of out Laweryes; a person for treason or fellony
absconding into another kingdom, after a process at Law by
which he is Summon’d to Come and take his tryal, and he
refuses then he is outlaw’d and all his Estate forfeited to
the king, and if Ever he be taken in y<sup>e</sup> Kings dominions he
is Immediately Executed w<sup>th</sup> out any farther tryal, and its
usual if such a one be known to be in a kingdom of our
allies to make a Demand of him by the ambassadour, and
such a state takes Care Either to deliver him up or Else to
Expel him their Dominions by proclamation, that none
harbour such a one but deliver up to the government.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is noe wracks or tortures nor noe slaves made, only
such as are banish’d sometymes into our forreign plantations
there to worke, we have also prisons for debtors and
some of which are privilidge places, as y<sup>e</sup> Kings Bench the
Marshalsea and Fleete which persons Entring themselves
prisoners there Cannot further be prosecuted, but Continue
there prisoners dureing Life, and out of the term tymes hire
a keeper of the prison to go allwayes with him as a jaylor;
but the Chief Master must have good security to produce
him Every term Else he will be Lyable to pay his debts, so
its only for such as are debtors, and Indeed its a sad thing
they should be so suffer’d and that there should be places
of refuge for such. There is one good act to relieve persons
that are Confined it may be out of Malice and spleen to
keep them allwayes so, but by this act any such Can sue
out his habeas Corpus and soe be brought the first day of
the terme Either to a tryal or give bail and soe be Let out.</p>

<p class='c012'>Besides this there are in most Lordships, Courts kept
which are Courts Banns and was at first the only jurisdiction
by Each gentleman held, all misdemeanours punished, and
by them Informed up to the higher courts of Kings Bench or
Chancery, and alsoe had all their own privelidges maintained
amongst their tennants and neighbours, and Consisted of a
Court Life also which ran in y<sup>e</sup> same nature with their
session Courts. These our Laws are Esteemed the best in
y<sup>e</sup> world, we haveing two distinct parts, one Comon Law
which is singular to our nation and are managed in these
sessions, assizes, Kings Bench, and Common pleas, and Exchequor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>the other is the Civil Law which is the only sort
of Law in any other Kingdom, of which the Chancery, the
Arches w<sup>ch</sup> is under the archbishop and by his appoyntm<sup>t</sup>
to the severall Judges of that Court that are all Civillians,
matters of Equitty, all probats of wills, w<sup>ch</sup> in the Arches
are made and recorded. This is in a place in the Citty the
Doctors Commons where is this Court of Arches and prorogative
Court which Consists of Doctors, Chancelours,
Proctors, Suragats w<sup>ch</sup> do y<sup>e</sup> offices of Councellours attorney
and Solicitours at Common Law. There are registers also
from this at London. All the Bishops courts are kept in
each Citty, managed by Chancelours which are Lay men,
and the suragats, also the Bishops deputyes, the proctors,
and parolers, which summons all to it, and there are four in
a year in Each County. From hence are given out Licenses
for marriages, here are y<sup>e</sup> Cannon Laws of the Church
explain’d and defended, all Church officers punish’d and
examin’d, here are proceeding on Information all persons
that infringe the Church Rites, and formerly all that were
vitious and Corrupt in their practices, even of y<sup>e</sup> Clergy also,
and receiv’d suspension or some punishm<sup>t</sup> due to the Crime,
as Excommunication, but evil men and governours corrupt
and Change wholesome Laws to Evil, so of Late these
Laws have been put in Execution against tender Consciences
that could not Comply to some forms prescrib’d
in the Litturgy of the Church of England, and they have
been Excommunicated, after which they are turned over to
the Lay Chancellour and so prosecuted at Common Law
because the spiritual Courts and men will not pretend to
use the sword of punishment, but while they have turned
its Edge thus against y<sup>e</sup> tender Consciences scrupleing the
forms of worship in the Church of England, they have Left
punishing the enormous Crimes of their parishoners nay of
their Clergy also, to the scandal of Protestants. Indeed
blessed be God that since King William and Queen Mary
of happy memory Weilded the scepter, and Liberty for
such descenters have been Establish’d by an act of Parliam<sup>t</sup>,
of which houses shall now speake of. Our Kingdom is
governed by Laws made and Establish’d pursuant to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>first Constitutions and Magna-Charta, from which is derived
all the Charters full of priviledges to each Corporation in
the Kingdom, suiteable to their Customs and well being of
each; these Laws are made and are not truely authentick
if not Enacted and pass’d by our three states which is King,
Lords and Commons, which Can make Laws for all Cases
provided they are for the good of the whole and do not
tend to subvert our originall Contract grounded on our
Magna Charta or ffundamental Laws of the Land, which
Constitution is by all the world esteemed the best if kept
on each ones Basis, a tripple foundation, and when y<sup>e</sup> King
Exerts not his prerogative beyond its Limitts to the oppressing
his peoples priviledges, nor the people exorbitant and
tumultuous in the standing or running up their power and
priviledges to Cloud and bind up the hands of the prince.
But if it goes in an Equal and just footeing, the people
whose is the purse and strength will maintaine the King
and his Councellours, and they will do the best offices to
the King from the people, and so the King might allwayes
reigne in his peoples hearts by Love as well as over them,
and they yeild duty and obedience to him, and securely
repose in him that should so studdy to preserve them in all
their privilidges and trade, which would procure us honour
and admiration to the whole world, and Continue us too
greate for Enemyes to invade or molest us and so great as
to have all seeke to be our allies, and those that were so
would find a secure trust and faithfull friends in us, but
alas! its too sadly to be bemoaned y<sup>e</sup> best and sweetest
wine turns soonest sour, some by folly faction and wickedness
have endeavour’d our own ruin, and were it not for
Gods providentiall Care and miraculous works we should at
this day been a people Left to utter dispaire haveing only
the agraveteing thoughts of our once happy Constitution
to Lament its Losse the more. To go on the Parliament
which in Westminster Hall has appartments, the one for y<sup>e</sup>
house of Lords and Called the Upper House, where all the
Lords which are not papists and w<sup>ch</sup> are of age do sitt in
their order on benches Covered with scarlet cloth, the
Bishops Likewise sitt as peers of the realme and have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>voices in all Causes, but in bloud the sanguinary Laws and
decision there on its said they may sitt, but they from their
order in the Church alwayes go out, but they first make
their claime that they might continue, but all other of y<sup>e</sup>
Lords if absent can give their proxy to another Lord and
desire him to give his voice in matters debateable in his
absence, and any such Lord Chuses another that he knows
to be of his own sentiments, or should give him account at
any case he should differ that may have the absent Lords
real Consent, which has happened that a Lord has given his
own voice one way and the proxy voice another as the
absent Lord shall direct, but this is seldome and this is
permitted because sickness or Extraordinary buissness of
their own, the Kings, or the peoples, may require his
absence. Now the Lords w<sup>ch</sup> are peeres of the realme are
born Councellors to the King and are Looked on as such,
its true tho’ at all tymes they may and should give the
King their advice yet y<sup>e</sup> King has power and do make
Choice of a privy Councill, which consist of Lords temporall
and spirituall, w<sup>ch</sup> are Bishops, and also out of some
of y<sup>e</sup> Commons of England which are the Gentry. In this
house of Lords the judges as I said before sitts but have
noe vote. The Lord Chancellor or Keeper of the Seale sitts
and is speaker to that house, but if he be noe peer which
sometymes happens, and is at this tyme in Right Lord
keeper of the Seale, then I say he has no voice in any
matter and serves them only as their servant or officer to
put questions to Count their voice on their dividing on a
matter, to make a speech to them from y<sup>e</sup> King, and to
present anything to y<sup>e</sup> King, and he sitts on a wool-pack to
just under the throne where the king sitts when there which
is seldome but to pass bills. On each side of the throne is
two stooles, y<sup>t</sup> on the Right hand is for the Prince of Wales
if any is, that on the Left to the first Duke prince of the
blood royal or kings brother that is heir more remote.
Behind the throne is a place for the noblemens sonns
minors to be, to give them opportunity to heare and instruct
them in the Laws of England. In the middle of
the roome is tables w<sup>th</sup> bookes and records, and there sitts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>the secretarys of state which are two, these with some
under them take the minutes of what is debated and resolved.
The Lords do form Law agreable to the fundamentall
Laws in which the judges advise them. They thus
form a bill which being in all poynts examined, all objections
answered, and being well amended and passed three
tymes, being read and agreed, is Carryed down to the Lower
house which Consists of the Commons of England Chosen
by a precept from the Crown to all the Sherriffs of the
Countys to Chuse amongst themselves two of Each Corporation
or Burrough, and two for each County which are Called
knights of y<sup>e</sup> shire, to represent them in this assembly. All
that are free-holders of a County has a voice to Choose.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Corporations and Burroughs Chuse by their freemen
also, but because of the peculiar Customs and priviledges in
each place it makes some variation. Those that have most
of voices which are Legal to Chuse, the Bailiff or major of
the place or sherriffs return up to the Crown office, from
whence the precept Came, the Name of such persons so
Chosen to sitt in the parliament. This was an Excellent
Constitution and order when kept to its order that none
were Chosen but the Gentlemen of the shire or town Living
there, or Else the Chiefe of their Corporation that Lived
there, by w<sup>ch</sup> meanes they were fully instructed what was
for the weale and good of Each place they serv’d for, and
so Could promote designes for their advantage and trade
and represent their Grievances to be redress’d, they also
know the strength and riches of the nation and soe Could
with a more Equal hand Lay y<sup>e</sup> taxes on all answerable to
their ability; but instead of this the nation is so Corrupted
that what with hopes of prefferrment at Court or being
skreen’d by their priviledges from paying their debts, which
is thus: dureing the sessions or forty dayes before or after,
such as are parliament men Cannot be arrested or troubled
for money they owe, y<sup>e</sup> reason at first was well grounded
that these persons were known to be, and in Case a
troublesome person had money due and had been delay’d
by some Extraordinary Cause that this troublesome person
might find such a one at the parliament house might Lay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>him in prison and so hinder y<sup>e</sup> buissness of the nation. But
this is abused to a great prejudice of the subject, men run
out of their Estates strive to get into the Parliament to be
skreen’d from their Creditors; and how Can those that are
worth Little or nothing be good disposers of the kingdom
treasure or priviledges, or stand up for them, but by this
there is such bribeing by debauching by drinke and giving
them mony, y<sup>t</sup> Instead of the parliament men which use to
be Chosen to be the Countrys representatives and servants,
to whome they allowed soe much a day for their expences
in London from their homes while attending the parliament,
that now those that would be parliament men spend prodigious
summs of money to be Chosen. Some to serve for
knights of y<sup>e</sup> shire have spent 1000 and 1500<sup>lb</sup> and for Corporation
and Burroughs in proportion, so y<sup>t</sup> they Come in
with design to be bribed by the Court or any body y<sup>t</sup> has
any buisness before them, y<sup>t</sup> so they may be reemburz’d
and may gaine more—some place at Least they Expect and
these Care Little for y<sup>e</sup> good of y<sup>e</sup> nation, being for the
most part perfect strangers to the places for whome they
serve, and consequently to all their Circumstances and so
can appeare for none of them to their advantage, indeed its
their own game they mainly aime and pursue, for they have
in their power to form good Laws suiteable to the fundamentall
and Explanatory of such with additionalls to them,
tending to the enlargeing as well as secureing their priviledges.
Such Laws being brought in manner of a bill is
read three tymes three severall dayes, so as all the members
might or should have tyme to heare debate, consider and
amend it, and Every member of this house of Commons
that are so chosen and have met and take the oathes
required of allegiance, they Come up to the house of Lords
where y<sup>e</sup> King meetes them and desires them to Chuse a
speaker for themselves out of their own number, which they
do and Come and present him to the King for his approbation,
w<sup>ch</sup> done the King makes them a speech and tells
them what is requisite to be done relateing to the Crown, to
fforreign things if any warre or any breach of peace any
injury from thence, what is necessary to be done thereon, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>any want of money which they only Can supply, the
reasons of its wants, his promise well and faithfully to
dispose it, he exhorts them to rectifye disorders in practice
and soe dismisses them. This speaker of theirs is the
Kings officer Dureing his being speaker and has a sallery
and must keep a Great table. The king gives him one
thousand pound presently to fitt him in his Equipage, he
always goes in Coach or a foote haveing a mace carry’d
before him, he has the advantage of all bills brought into
the house a Certainty for Each, he has the advantage of all
the votes printed, to sell them, he sitts in a Chaire above all
the rest of the House to give him advantage to see or heare
any member that speakes. He is to put all Questions, to
Count the voices of noes and yeas on y<sup>e</sup> division of the
house. There are many Comittees in this house as well as
in the Lords House, appoynted by the whole to Inspect
severall buissness, and to form bills on such buissness to be
brought in to the house. If it be a matter of great Consequence
there may be a Comittee of the whole house which
is only thus, y<sup>e</sup> speaker Leaves his Chaire and they resolve
themselves into such a Committee and debate matters, and
for that tyme Choose a Chairman for the Committee.
Then the speaker reasumes the Chaire and this Chaireman
of y<sup>e</sup> Comittee reports the debate of y<sup>t</sup> Committee to the
Speaker and whole House. When there is a full house,
which may be never was, there is 500 as I said before.
When they have pass’d a bill thrice through the house with
approbation they send it up to the Lords, and if they pass
it three tymes also without amendment then it is jnGross’d,
haveing been pass’d the two states, and so Lyes ready to
pass the Last which is the Kings Consent. But if either the
bills sent down by the Lords are amended by y<sup>e</sup> Comons,
and when brought up to the Lords againe and they Like
not those amendments then they Cast out the bill; so Likewise
any bill sent up by the Commons for the Lords assent in
Case they make amendments which y<sup>e</sup> Comons Like not
then they Cast out their bill; but if Each other agree to
the amendments or pass the bills without amendment
through both houses then they are Engross’d and prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>for the Royal assent, the third state of our government w<sup>ch</sup>
is in this manner. The King sends to y<sup>e</sup> house of Lords to
attend him in their own house, with their Robes w<sup>ch</sup> are
Scarlet Cloth with Earmine and Rows of Earmine w<sup>th</sup> gold
galloone on Each row, the rows are Encreassed to Each
dignity and here y<sup>e</sup> bishops weare robes w<sup>ch</sup> are scarlet
also, but they have about their neck a Large Cape w<sup>ch</sup>
hangs to their waste all round of a ffurr that Lookes Like
Lambskinns, it hangs Like the Capes of the Cloakes y<sup>e</sup>
shepheards weare in the open plaine downes. The King
enters; or the Queen as now it is—but I saw King William
pass bills in his Royal Robes of Purple Lined Earmine w<sup>th</sup>
rows of Earmine and the crown on his head which was the
Crown I spake of that had great pearles on the cross and
saphires Rubies and Emeraulds—the Scepter in their hand—the
Usher of the Black Rod is sent to the House of Comons
to attend the King in the House of Lords which they do,
with their Speaker that brings up such bills w<sup>ch</sup> are so
prepared and holds them in his hand, one by one presenting
them to the King, who touches them with the scepter
and sayes, “je le veux bieu” and so to all of them one by
one, w<sup>ch</sup> done if there be any thing necessary to be told
them, the king either speakes to them or Else orders the
Lord Chancellour or Lord Keeper to acquaint them of any
thing in the Kings name if its the Kings pleasure to prorogue
y<sup>m</sup> for a few dayes weekes or months. Then that putts an
End to that session till the tyme prefix’d and at that tyme
they must meete againe without summons, and if they are
not to meete so soone, y<sup>e</sup> king Issues out a proclaimation y<sup>t</sup>
its his pleasure y<sup>e</sup> parliament should be prorogued so much
Longer. These prorogations allwayes puts an end to all
debates and all bills which are not ffinished and brought the
king to pass, so that at their meeteing againe they must
begin the things they would have or were about the Last
tyme anew. This prorogation is in the kings power and is
often done for ten dayes only to put a stop to heares and
debates in the houses, and also to put an end to something
that is not Lik’d by y<sup>e</sup> government. True Indeed they may
begin y<sup>e</sup> same things at their next meeteing, but if it be for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>the great and absolute service of the nation they may, but its
contrived in another method so as not openly to Confront
our governours, tho’ too often we have seen it in our dayes
against our Glorious truely great King William whose wisdom
and Compassion for our good pass’d it by and forgave it. Now
in some Cases the King may and does call the Parliament
by a proclaimation to sitt before the tyme of the prorogation
be Expired which takes it off. The parliament does often
adjourn themselves, as every night so sometymes for a
weeke, but still the parliament is Look’d on as in sitting and
so buisness is not jnterrupted but goes on from day to day
as they appoint it. The king may also adjourn them and
the two Houses may be adjourned together, but sometymes
they may adjourn seperately, for one may adjourn themselves
and y<sup>e</sup> other Continue to act within themselves. Its also in
the Kings power to dissolve y<sup>e</sup> parliament w<sup>ch</sup> puts a finall
End to all their buisness which was not ffinished and
brought to the King to pass, it also disperses the members
of y<sup>e</sup> House of Commons to be noe more representatives of y<sup>e</sup>
nation till another parliament be summon’d and y<sup>e</sup> nation
make new Choices, which sometymes and in some places
falls on the old members. It is in the Kings prerogative
thus to Call and disolve parliaments, to declare warre or
peace and making alliances, but y<sup>e</sup> Kings ought not nor do
rightly undertake any such thing but by the advice of his
standing Privy Councill, which I have spoken before, and so
his proclaimations allwayes runs by and with the advice of
his Privy Councill he does so and so, to which he joyns y<sup>e</sup>
great Councill of the nation w<sup>ch</sup> is his two Houses of
Parliament, Lords spiritual and temporall and Commons of
England, when great matters are in agitation as y<sup>t</sup> of peace
or warre, w<sup>ch</sup> is in y<sup>e</sup> Constitution of the government, and
strengthened by this that the sinnews of warre is in the
people, for without them no money is to be had; they give
the taxes and subsidies for such expences, nay y<sup>e</sup> very
revenue is given by them to the King or the Queen only
dureing the then prince’s Life and must be asked of them
that succeed at the death of their predecessors, at the death
of such that is in the throne. Formerly the Parliament of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Course was dissolved, all offices even to a justice of peace
was vacant, but our wise King William contriveing only our
good not only Laid a scheme which if be followed will carry
on all the Confederacys and designes against the Common
Enemy of mankind, but also as farre as he could to secure
our peace w<sup>ch</sup> was by obtaining an Act of Parliam<sup>t</sup> that y<sup>e</sup>
parliament in being when y<sup>e</sup> King died or Else the parliament
but just then dissolv’d by the King, after he dies
should assemble together to take care of the government
and to act under y<sup>e</sup> next prince for six months, and till that
tyme all offices should remain as they were unless the next
heir should before y<sup>t</sup> full tyme were Expired should make
any Change of places. This thing made the Loss of his
death Less felt immediately and our Queen Ann found a
quiet Easye ascention into the throne. there was also at the
same tyme an Act to settle the succession in the protestant
Line, and just before our heroe resign’d his Life crown and
throne he pass’d an Act to secure us more firmly against
any popish successour or pretended heirs to the Crown, by
an abjuration oath to be taken by all subjects, of any prince
thats a papist, w<sup>ch</sup> Confirms the Acts of Parliam<sup>t</sup> in years
past which made a papist prince unable to be king or queen
of England, because a papest. So this Engages the subjects
to abjure all such or any of their abbettors or pretenders.
This was a great pleasure to our dying king to Leave us
with all the Security possible to Enjoy what he Came to
save us in, and give us and what he had fought to obtaine
for us, Liberty in religion and priviledges. I pray God we
do not by our provokeing sinns move his anger not only to
take from us our Benefactor and deliverer but also our said
valuable Blessings and priviledges, the Gospel Light and
being a free nation.</p>

<p class='c012'>I should have said when the king Comes in his robes
to the Parliament and all the Lords have theirs, so if there
be any Prince of Wales he is also in his and weares his
Prince of Wales Cap with a branch of diamonds in forme of
a plume of feathers. He sitts in the house of Lords often—he
may allwayes—to hear debates and to vote and he does
present them to the king any of their addresses they desire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>which he is attended with some of the Lords which are the
privy Councellors; they bring back the kings answere.
The Like is observ’d by the House of Commons, if they
have any address or any petition to the king they desire
some of their members which are of the Privy Councill to
move y<sup>e</sup> King when the House shall attend him or her,
which they knowing do it and their Speaker is their mouth.
So when they would have a Conferrence with y<sup>e</sup> House of
Lords they send to them to meete them in y<sup>e</sup> painted
Chamber or Lobby of their house; so does the Lords send
to y<sup>e</sup> Commons when they would have a Conferrence with
them. These things are so well adjusted and so for the
Common good that if Rightly maintain’d in their proper
places would be a happy Constitution. All Acts of Parliament
so pass’d are printed, but y<sup>e</sup> records of them are kept
in the journalls of y<sup>e</sup> Parliament by the Clerke of y<sup>e</sup> Parliament.
To him are added in the House of Commons also
scribes or secretaryes which record and take minutes also.
Now it is on these Laws that all Causes are tryed, for there
are Laws made of all sorts both what relates to religious
matters as well as humaine; true indeed as to points of
religion for Rectifying matters as to the orders and Church
government, that is debated and agreed by a Convocation,
which is allwayes summoned at y<sup>e</sup> same tyme a parliament
is Chosen, which Consists of two houses, also the Bishops
and deanes, and off the Inferior Clergy, and is managed by
way of debates and disputation which have a moderatour
and prolocutors. Here they endeavour to reforme any
abuse in the Church, any deffect in their Cannon Laws, and
to Explaine those Laws and if they should find such, as in
our religion not agreable to y<sup>e</sup> word of God, they form it
into a bill or petition which is presented the King in way
of an address, he being owned as head and supreame under
Christ over these Churches and realmes. So this is to
request his Care of it which y<sup>e</sup> King does by Laying it
before y<sup>e</sup> Houses of Parliament who Enacts Laws to secure
our religion, and reforme evil both in Doctrine and practise
by their Acts Duely pass’d. As I said before the arch-Bishop’s
Chiefe of this convocation house.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span> Next I will proceed to give some short account of tryalls
on our Laws which is thus. Every free man of England
being oppress’d Comes in due form of Law to demand his
right, which being heard by the judges and a jury of his
own fellow subjects—his Country men—they give their
verdict in the matter as they thinke most just according to
the statutes and Laws, and so the right between man and
man which does vary from y<sup>e</sup> different Customs of Each
County or precinct. This jury are twelve men all sworne
on the Bible solemnly to do Justice, not out of feare, fraud
or malice, favour or affection to jnjure any man, and y<sup>e</sup> first
man is their foreman and speakes for the rest, Either acquit
or Condemns the person, w<sup>ch</sup> is in Life or Death, so determining
other Causes the same manner, and these twelve
men must all be agreed in their verdict, which is after they
have heard all Can be witness’d or alleadged on all sides,
w<sup>ch</sup> verdict the Judges also must pronounce on y<sup>e</sup> Causes as
they have brought it in. Now those suites of Law as well
as Causes of Life and death are brought in by bill to y<sup>e</sup>
Grand-jury, which are twenty four and these all of the best
Gentry and many of them justices of peace, they examine
the matter and if they find it (that is by any Act of Parliament)
is pleadable or to be enquired into, they draw it up
into an jndictm<sup>t</sup> and so its sent into the Court to be tryed
by the Petty Jury, after whose Verdict and the Judges
pronouncing it, the matter must be at an End and taken
out of that Court. Sometymes indeed if the Subject is
oppress’d he may appeale to another Court y<sup>ts</sup> higher, as
from the sessions to the assizes, thence to the Kings Bench,
thence to y<sup>e</sup> Chancery, or the Parliament House which when
a matter has there been Debated and decided there Can be
noe more done in it because they are the makers of the
Laws so best able to Interpret. Sometymes in these other
Courts a Jury brings in a matter speciall, that is, Leaves it
on the Judges to determine being a matter of Law, then y<sup>e</sup>
Judges must Consult and do it all of them together.</p>

<p class='c012'>All persons are tryed by those of their own ranke a
Commoner of England is tryed by a Jury of Commoners in
all Cases and of Life and death, a peer of England is tryed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>by his Peers, and in case it is not the tyme of y<sup>e</sup> Parliament
sitting, then by a bill of oyer and terminer issued out, there
is 12 Peers are jmpannell’d as a jury. But I must mention
one thing as to the petty Juryes of Commoners, a person
which is tryed for his Life may Challenge some of those w<sup>ch</sup>
are brought to be sworne for his Jury, that is except against
them to such a number without giving reason, but if he
exceeds that number he must give reason for such exception,
either to be a man he had injured or one w<sup>ch</sup> had
former malice or one related to y<sup>e</sup> persons who Either is
dead or injured; for our Laws Condemn to Death murther,
fellony, treasons. By this order you see its Justice and
Care. Then in matters of Life and Death the witness for
the King are sworne, but y<sup>e</sup> witness for the prisoners are not
sworne but only Examined to declare the truth. But to
returne to the tryals of a peer which by such a jury is tryed,
in Case the house of Lords y<sup>e</sup> parliament is sitting, then
they prepare Westminster hall for the tryal, the House of
Comons manage the Evidence and prosecute them, and the
House of Lords are the Judges and Jury in this manner if
it be for Life or death, w<sup>ch</sup> is grounded on a statute either
against murther, treason or fellony, and so y<sup>e</sup> arraignment
is read and y<sup>e</sup> Councill for both sides. Y<sup>e</sup> house of
Commons produces their Evidence and witness and the
King Constitutes a Lord High Steward for that day or
in case the tryal be long he must be Continued till the
tryall finishes. He beares a white staff as badge of his
great office which Indeed is y<sup>e</sup> greatest officer in England
and for the tyme can act for the King, so above him. He
is usually the person that is Lord Chancellor if he be a peer
which allwayes is. There he sitts as Judge to whome the
other peeres of the whole House of Lords are Joyn’d and
after a full Examination on both sides, and the Criminall
haveing had full Leave to Cleer himself, then the Lord High
Steward askes y<sup>e</sup> Lords one by one beginning with the
puny Lord, so to the highest “in honour my Lord such a
one do you thinke my Lord that the prisoner at the Barre is
guilty or not Guilty?”—to which Each Lord stands up and
answeres for himself Either, so as he Judges, “guilty upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>my honour,” or Else “not guilty upon my honour” and so
it goes from one to all, in this manner the Lord High
Steward marks down to Each Lords name his answere, and
at the Last reckons them up so many Guiltyes, so many not
Guiltyes, then he adds his own thoughts to the side he
thinks best, but usualy he is so Crafty as to add to the side
of the Majority, which being done he pronounces the verdict
as y<sup>e</sup> majority said, Either Guilty or not. Now this verdict
the Lords give thus on their honour is Equivalent to the
oath the Commoners take that serve in Juryes, for y<sup>e</sup> peeres
take no oath in these matters, otherwise than so. Now in
Case y<sup>e</sup> matter against a peer be only a Law matter of
nuise-prise, then the matter being debated and the answere
by y<sup>e</sup> Lord made in his deffence read, and Councell
pleading, then y<sup>e</sup> Lord High Steward askes Each Lord in
same order as before, but in this forme “in y<sup>e</sup> matter which
has been debated before y<sup>r</sup> Lord —— Concerning
the Lord at the Barre w<sup>th</sup> his deffence whether his
deffence be sufficient to Cleer him or not what sayes y<sup>r</sup>
Lordships Content or not content on y<sup>r</sup> honour?” they all
answer as they are affected or understand y<sup>e</sup> matter
“content,” or else “not content” which are fixed to each
name and so reckon’d up, and y<sup>e</sup> majority Carry’s it Either
to quitt or not to quitt him, to which the Lord High
Steward adds his as he pleases also, after which they shew
the High Steward a respect as a king. He is serv’d
on the knee and drinkes some wine and when that is
done he breakes his white staff and so pulls off his hatt.
When he was the High Steward he had all the maces
Carry’d before him all y<sup>e</sup> officers attending. But in case
there be no Chancellour, only a Lord Keeper as at present
is, which is no peer of y<sup>e</sup> realme then he has no vote with
y<sup>e</sup> Lords only Count up y<sup>e</sup> votes and declares them w<sup>ch</sup>
has the Majority, without the addition of his, haveing none,
and he is only substituted the deputy steward for the day
and so sitts, but on a wool sack as he does in the House of
Lords and is only their speaker and officer and must aske
Leave for himself and the Judges to put on their Caps
before they might do it, now the High Steward sitts in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>throne of justice under a Cannopy but I see this Lord
Keeper only sate on a wool sack at the foote of the throne
which stood Empty behind him. He had noe Compliment
paid him more than at another tyme, being only as the
Speaker to y<sup>e</sup> House of Lords and so their officer.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are severall great officers of y<sup>e</sup> Court as Lord
Treasurer which takes account of all the kings revenues—this
sometymes is in Commision between 3 or more.
There is also the High Admirall of England that has the
Command of all the shipps and stores. This sometymes is
in Comisions also of 3 or more under whome are y<sup>e</sup> Vice
Admirall and Rear Admirall, also und<sup>r</sup> the Treasurer are
severall officers. There is also two principal Secretaryes
of State which write all things, the Kings Lett<sup>rs</sup> &amp;c, and
relateing to the government, maintain all Inteligences in y<sup>e</sup>
kingdom and abroad.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is also a Master of the Generall Post Office that has
all the under masters and officers of y<sup>e</sup> posts both for forreign
Letters and inland Lett<sup>rs</sup>.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are also governours as Lord Lieutenant of Jreland—that
sometymes is held in Commission. There is also
Lords Justices there, all which have their Salleryes ariseing
out of the same kingdom. There is also to all our forreign
plantations govern<sup>rs</sup> sent from England and their salleryes
arise from the plantation. The Kings revenues arise from
y<sup>e</sup> Customs of goods exported and jmported, from the
Excise on all Liquors that are made in England and sold,
besides which there is a Considerable revenue from Lands
belonging to y<sup>e</sup> Crown, tho’ that is much Lessen’d by the
severall donations of our kings for many yeares to their
favourites. Out of those revenues all y<sup>e</sup> Civil List is maintain’d,
which is y<sup>e</sup> Judges salleries, the great officers, the
household of y<sup>e</sup> king. There is another great revenue in y<sup>e</sup>
Post Office, besides at all Extraordinary occasions of the
marriage of any of our princess’s their portion, or any warre,
then the Parliament raises taxes on the nation on Land or
trade, additional Customs, and also on the Excise, Encreasing
that under the Civil List is the Expences of the Court,
the guards, and also the ambassadors which are sent by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>king into forreign kingdoms to treate matters for Each
others good: their Expences while there are allowed and so
of all Envoyes or Consulls w<sup>ch</sup> are lesser Embassadours.
There is also the maintaining the navy, building shipps, the
wood of which Indeed is out of the King’s fforest.</p>

<p class='c012'>There remaines now only in what manner the kings or
queenes of England give publick audience to fforreigne
ambassadours Either when they Come in their first Entrance
or at the tyme of their takeing Leave; but first I may give
account of our Bishops and Gentry. There is 26 Bishopricks
with the two Archbishops Canterbury and york and
there are as many Cittyes and Cathedralls which in my
travells have described. All these Bishopricks are held of
the Crown and are Given by the king, to whome is due the
first fruites which is one yeares income of the Bishopricks.
They are held for Life, true jndeed they admit of being
removed from one Bishoprick to another for advancem<sup>t</sup>, nay
they may forfeit their Bishoprick by not being qualify’d, if
they will not sweare to be faithfull to y<sup>e</sup> government and so
they may be suspended, as in y<sup>e</sup> Case of severall in the last
revolution would not sweare to King William and Queen
Mary and so now refuse also to sweare to her present
Majesty Queen Ann. These Bishops are only Barrons in
themselves, their wives have noe honnour thereby nor their
Children; but for all peeres of England theirs is hereditary
from father to son and their Ladies partake of it, nay y<sup>e</sup>
honour descends on a daughter in default of male jssue.
The peere must first be made Barrons by which they hold
all their priviledges—Barrons of England—which is from y<sup>e</sup>
king by patent; all his Children are Called y<sup>e</sup> hon<sup>bl</sup> adding
the Christian name to their sirname, and this remaines to
daughters when marry’d. By this patent or another of y<sup>e</sup>
same they may be Created viscount, Earles, Marquesses,
dukes, and if they are dukes their patent Expresses all the
four other titles. Alsoe viscounts Children are the same w<sup>th</sup>
Barrons; and Earle’s, marquess, and duke’s are Called, the
daughters Lady, by their Christian names, before and after
marriage, unless they marry a Barron then they Lose y<sup>t</sup>
name and are Called a Barroness and so Loses their place.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>The Eldest son of an Earle is Called Lord by his fathers
title of Barron, the Eldest son of a Marquiss is Called Earle,
by the title of his fathers Earledome, and all marquiss’s
younger sons are Called Lord by their Christian name added
to their sirname. So the same of dukes Children, the
Eldest son is Called Marquiss. Now if any dowager to a
Lord marry a Private Gentleman she in Law is sullied and
has Lost her peeress, so if a Dutchess or Marquess or
Countess or viscountess marry a Barron or Either of the
degrees which was below her, she Looses it and is only
Called as the Lady of the present peer She has marry’d now.
Though these titles be given the noblemens sons and
Daughters its not that they are really soe, for in our Law
they are only Called and Esteemed in the first ranke of
Gentlemen, and so take place before all Gentlemen w<sup>t</sup>soever.
The Lower titles made by patents by y<sup>e</sup> king is Barronets,
and is differenc’d only from a Knight by takeing place of
all knights and that it is hereditary and goes from father to
son; a Knight only is for his own Life and the king makes
them thus: any Gentleman that is to be made a knight
kneeles down and y<sup>e</sup> king draws his sword asking him his
Christian name, Layes the sword on his head and shoulder,
and bids him rise up sir such a one as for Example S<sup>r</sup>
James Bateman our Last Sherriff &amp;c. These severall titles
and patents pays great fees to the severall officers according
to the ranke, a Duke cost £1000—, so in proportion. Y<sup>e</sup>
same manner the Knights of the Garter are made as other
knights nevertheless it may be to those w<sup>ch</sup> were dukes
before. Their jnstallment is at Windsor Castle, in this
manner: the herraulds which I have mentioned several
tymes before as a part and management of all the Cerimony,
and also the persons that studdy all matters of honours and
are the Recorders of all the titles in England, and all their
Coates of armour, and knows and keepes Each in their
ranke at all Cerimonyes, and gives out their armes for
Eschuteons at Every bodyes funeralls; they have an office
just by D<sup>r</sup> Commons by S<sup>t</sup> Pauls Cathedrall. There is one
Principal king at armes and 3 if not more other king at
armes and other under herraulds and Sergeants, which all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>weare Coates with the kings armes all aboute it; these as I
say officiates at the jnstalling for they record it and add the
blew garter about such a Lords atchievement. Y<sup>e</sup> Cerimony
I have in part described together with y<sup>e</sup> account of Windsor.</p>

<p class='c012'>Maulbery is in view at some distance from y<sup>e</sup> adjacent
hills and Lookes very fine, with a good river that turns
many mills. Its buildings are good and Compact, one
very Large streete where stands the market place and town
hall, and at Each end the two Churches, its of a great
Length jncludeing the two parishes, and the town stands
itself on a high hill. Beyond one of the Churches is the
Duke of Sommersets house, has been a greate Rambling
building but now most pulled down and newly building,
they were painting it, good appartments for what is done
but none furnish’d, and its but one Wing and is built with
drawing dineing roomes and bed Chambers with Closets
and dressing-roomes and two StairCases and some roomes
above, which is to have another such a wing on the other
side and Joyn’d with a Greate hall.</p>

<p class='c012'>The only Curious thing is out of y<sup>e</sup> bowling green. You
go many stepps down into a Grass-walke with quick sett
hedges cut Low, this Leads to the foote of the mount, and
that you ascend from y<sup>e</sup> Left hand by an Easye ascent
bounded by such quick sett hedges Cut Low, and soe you
rise by degrees in 4 rounds bounded by the Low Cutt hedge,
and on the top is with same hedge Cut in works, and from
thence you have a prospect of y<sup>e</sup> town and Country round
and two parishes two mile off in view, and the Low Grounds
are watered with ditches, and this mount is Encompass’d
about with such a Cannal which Emptys itself into a ffish
pond, then it Empts itself into the river. There is a house
built over the ffish pond to keep the ffish in. At the ffoote
of the mount as I began out of a Green walke on the Left
hand to ascend it, so on the Right hand Leads to another
such a walke quite round by y<sup>e</sup> Cannall to the other side of
y<sup>e</sup> bowling-green. In the midst of y<sup>e</sup> top of the mount was
a house built and pond but thats fallen down. Halfe way
down is a seate opposite to y<sup>e</sup> dwelling house which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>Brick’d. Maulbery is one of the towns in Wiltshire y<sup>e</sup>
quarter sessions is kept in, its 8 mile to Hungerford over
Savernack Forrest where is many deer. Ffrom Hungerford
to Newbury in Barkshire 7 mile all very deep way, 15 mile
thence to Reading in Barkshire flatt way, but y<sup>e</sup> vale is
heavy sand for 3 or 4 mile. Reading is the shire town, its
pretty Large and accomodated for travellers being a great
Road to Gloucester and y<sup>e</sup> West Country, but it is very
dear.</p>

<p class='c012'>From London to Rusbery 18 mile by Stanes—pretty
house and gardens in sight of Windsor in Buckinghamshire—thence
Uxbridge 7 mile, pretty good way, thence
Amersham 9 mile all in the Alesbury road, thence Barkminstead
6 Long miles, steep hills into Hartfordshire, a
good market town, good jnns, thence Dunstable 7 or 9
Long miles steep hills, thence Arsly in Bedfordshire 10
mile, which I Entred at Astick 2 mile from Arlsy, 2 good
old houses of the Edwards and Browns, but this was base
way, narrow, and Lanes Rooty and Long. Thence Bedford
town 9 miles good way, a village in a mile or two
distance, Hanlow, Clifton Sheford Checkston and Bedford.
Y<sup>e</sup> great road Comes in good way, thence Turvoy 5 mile
belonging to the Earle of Peterborough where he was.</p>

<p class='c012'>They make much bonelace in these towns. In the
Church are fine tombs and monuments of that familly,
the first with two Ladyes on Each side, he higher, one in a
widdows dress all marble finely Gilt and painted on a bed,
and Rowles of Matt very naturall at their head and feete.
There was another and the Lady dyed in Childbed the
Child by her Costly Carved and Gilt and 4 beadmen at the
feete (he allowed for four old mens maintenance), by it
another and his Lady all rich marble Gilt and painted.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here I Enter Buckinghamshire againe over the Bridge,
so to Northampton 10 mile over a pretty good road, and
Entred the shire within 4 mile of the town.</p>

<p class='c012'>I describe nothing more of Northampton, but the Church
was finish’d, the Entrance with a breast wall and paved
and stepps within round 3 sides of the Church, which was
begun w<sup>n</sup> I was there before. So I proceeded on to Litchfield
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>very good way as Exactly straight as a Line, the
Whatling Streete way, but it was deep heavy ground as
in all these Rich Countrys. I passed between two noble
seates, Homby on the Right hand on the side of a hill in
woods, stone buildings with towers almost Like a Castle,
old built, the rows of trees Exact on Each side and
avenues, which is Earle of Ffevershams. The other on the
left hand Lay Low within a thicket of wood on all sides but
the front, where it appear’d Like a Princes Court of Brick
and Stone, very fine, Lord Sunderlands, with a Large Parke
walled in of a good Extent. Thus I went to a Bridge not
very Large of stone but it is the Boundary of three Countys.</p>

<p class='c012'>I pass’d from Northampton into Leicestershire with
Warwickshire on my Left hand, and so went to a Rich
Land, here it Lookes of a Redder Earth.</p>

<p class='c012'>I Came to Cross wayes where was a Latterworth hand
poynting 4 wayes to Coventry, Leicester, London, and
Litchfield, and some thing farther to High Crosse which
is Esteemed y<sup>e</sup> middle of England, where the two great
Roads meete that divides the Kingdom in the Saxons
tyme in 4 parts, the Whatling Streete on which still I
Continued, and the Ffosse way; thus to a Little place
Called Smockington, fitted for jnns, on a Road, very
Comodious. Here I Lay in Warwickshire 10 mile, thence
6 mile to Anderton and Talmouth 7, where I Enter
Staffordshire, soe Litchfield 6 mile, thence Woolsly Eight,
from thence to Budsworth, Lord Pagets in a ffine Parke,
Large Coale mines about it. The house is old but the
front very regular, 3 Juttings out, Large Compass windows,
a good Little parlour, out of the hall another Large one
with drawing roome and bed Chamber and good back
staires and Entrys, Large Light fit for attendance. then
you go up and Enter a dineing roome, drawing roome and
Chamber, a Long gallery that is the Length of the house
and broad, and which adds to its greatness. The End
opens doores on a terrass out in the garden of same breadth
and Length up to an orchard or wilderness which Lookes
very nobly. Here at Each End is two good Chambers of
state, Lofty, with anty Chambers and for servants and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>back staires. There are many very good roomes of a
second rate w<sup>ch</sup> if well ffurnish’d would Look well. The
Leads are a greate many stepps up on the top, a Large
Cupilow of windows, and y<sup>e</sup> walls round y<sup>e</sup> Leads are so
high a person of a middle stature Cannot Look over them
scarce when on tiptoe, which is a Greate Lessening of its
beauty w<sup>ch</sup> would give a Large prospect round of the
Country of 10 or 12 miles off. There is an addition of
new wall on the battlements w<sup>ch</sup> is visible so its Likely it
was from some accident from y<sup>e</sup> Leads Enduced y<sup>e</sup> walls
being built higher. This Lord has a greate Command and
Royalty in the County, the Kank forrest of 20 mile is his,
most of y<sup>e</sup> gentlemen in the County pay him Chiefe Rent
and some hold Right in some of their Land by waiteing on
him on some solemn feast dayes in the yeare, and bring up
his dinner and waite on him as he Eates, if then in the
Country. But these things are better wav’d then sought
and is not done few tymes in an age to keep up the
Custom.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom Woolsly after an 8 weekes stay I went to Wolverhampton
11 long mile, then to Church-hill neare Sturbridge
9 or 10 mile farther, by the many Glasshouses where they
Blow Broad Glass, but they were not at work on that sort
when I was there. At Church-hill was at a farmer Like a
Gentleman’s, a new pretty house of brick, but wanted
ffurniture and Cleaneing and good order, but a hearty
M<sup>r</sup> and M<sup>rs</sup>. The hill is pretty high and gives a great view
of the Country which most belongs to M<sup>r</sup> Foley-Tom of
10,000<sup>£</sup>—Large Comonage, there he has a Little Lodge,
new brick; his own house is 6 or 10 mile thence all within
his own grounds, and has great jron works and mines, this
is within two mile of Kederminster, as farre on the other
side to Sturbridge. Thence I went to Worcester town a
sandy way, and here are in some places quicksands. This
is a 10 Long mile to Worcester but pretty flatt way for
the most part, thence to Newhouse 12 or 14, the basest
way for hills, stony narrow hollow wayes very difficult to
pass.</p>

<p class='c012'>I went from Newhouse to Stoake four miles, M<sup>r</sup> Foley’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>the speaker’s son has a very fine pile of building, the wing
to Herreford being now up in the Shell, which is all for
state, great parlour, drawing roome, and bed Chambers,
with their appendixes and backstaires, and a great staircase
with Chambers over for state. This is Entred into out of
the Greate hall, the middle of the house raiseing many
stepps out of the Court, the Entrance to which on Each
side has buildings uniform for Coach house stables, dairy
out houses. The wing to the garden side is finish’d, being
their appartment, a pretty staircase that two Easily go up,
light from the Skye, jron railes and barristers, this from an
arch jsle below which goes to the kitchen, and hath a
doore into this front Court and into the gate backward,
tho’ not visible on the garden side by y<sup>e</sup> disguise of painting.
From this you ascend these staires to the dineing
roome which is Even to the great hall and must Enter
from it when ffinish’d. Out of this on the Right hand was
M<sup>r</sup> Paul Folie’s the father’s studdy, long and Large, with
back staires and a servants roome. On the Left hand is a
drawing roome, beyond his Ladys bed Chamber, Closet
and Servants roome, and next it are these staires of jron
Railes that goes up to the next stage, which is over this
same wing and is the appartment of the young M<sup>r</sup> Folie
and his Lady which now is the heir and in possession.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is their Chamber, her fine Closet, a servants roome
and a Large studdy for him; there is also two Large
Chambers for strangers which takes the whole wing over
the dineing roome and studdy. There is also a Little
roome at the end for strangers opposite to M<sup>r</sup> folie’s roome
which Lookes to the front. This dineing roome is what
they Eate in allwayes—is well wanscoated. There is a
fountaine bason just faceing y<sup>e</sup> balcony doore that Leads
to a terrass paved with black and white marble and jron
palisadoes; it has a long space and broad for walking and
two Enclosed on Each side by same jron work a step up
or two these doores from y<sup>e</sup> Ladies Closet and the Studdy,
out on them in the middle goes the staires two wayes, all
jron work, and meete halfe way and Joyne in y<sup>e</sup> next
descent on Gravel, which is in a halfe moon and so design’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>to be Left in a Low place with a Cascade beneath, and the
Gravell walke and grass walks to go by it and beyond it in
many rows of trees. The walled Gardens and walks one
below another. This terrass gives a vast prospect of the
Country, it being scituated on the ascent of a hill. Many
rows of trees in Meadows below it adds to its beauty being
all within his own Ground, he has a Great Estate and a
Great parke up above it with Great woods. The adornment
of the Rooffe is flower potts and ffigures Globes and
Scallop shells, it will be noble Compleate buildings and
deserves 10000<sup>£</sup> a yeare to Live Like it.</p>

<p class='c012'>The offices are all below and Even with the first Entrance
of the ffront, what is ffinished is neate good wanscoate
and tapistry, there is two or three damaske beds and
one velvet one what they had before, so noe new ffurniture
but y<sup>e</sup> best wing noe doubt will be finely finish’d and
furnish’d. The prospect is Large and jndeed to view, at
Least in the summer and in Drye tyme, Herrifordshire is
Like a fruitfull Garden. Near Richards Castle is the Bone
well a fountain alway full of ffish and ffroggs bones tho’
often Cleared of them yet still renewed.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom Newhouse I Came over Maubern Hills which are
Like the Alps and have had much wet, the roads deep
and difficult, to upton in Worcester 10 mile, where I pass
the severn on a stone bridge—here it is not broad. Thence
Pursha 5 mile, thence Esham 4 and Weston 4, in Glocestershire
to my Cos’n Ffiennes, thence to Morton Hindmost up
a vast stony high hazardous hill of neare two mile Long
ascending all the way from Weston—this is in sight of
Cambden—so to Morton, 6 miles down as steep a stony
hill 2 mile before I Came to my aunts. Thence to
Broughton in Oxfordshire passing by 4 shires stone—Warwick,
Worcester, Glocester and Oxfordshire, and so
by Kingston; thence to oxford 18, Abbington where is a
fine town Hall for the Judges, two barrs and all seates
aboute set on stone pillars, the staires to the top is about

to Newbery by Market Hillsly its 16 mile, which town has
been famous for whipps and presents a King or Queen
when they pass through it with one of great price and also
w<sup>th</sup> a purse of Gold. From thence to Way hill through

Newtontony in Wiltshire 6 mile.</p>

<p class='c012'>Some account of Epsome in Surrey about ten miles from
London. Its on Clay and Gravel, the waters are from Alum.
The well is Large without Bason or Pavement, on the
bottom it is Covered over with timber and is so darke you
Can scarce Look down into it for which Cause I do dislike
it. Its not a quick spring and very often is dranke drye,
and to make up the defficiency the people do often carry
water from Common wells to fill this in a morning; this
they have been found out in which makes the water weake
and of Little opperation unless you Can have it first from
the well before they Can have put in any other. The
usual way of drinking them is by turning them with a
Little milk. There is a walk of trees by it, but not very
pleasant, there is a house built in which the well is and
that is paved with brick to walke in in the wet weather,
and where people have Carrawayes sweetemeates and tea &amp;c,
but it Look’d so dark and unpleasant more Like a Dungeon,
y<sup>t</sup> I would not Chuse to drinke it there, and most people
drink it at home. There are severall good Buildings in
Epsome for Lodgings and good Gardens behind them for
walking. There is a good house of the L<sup>d</sup> Bartlets in a
parke at the End of the town Looks very well. The
Greatest pleasure of Emson is Either Banstead Downs
where is good aire and good rideing for Coaches and horses,
with a pleasant view of y<sup>e</sup> Country, or Else Box Hill which
is 6 or 7 miles off and is the Continuation of the Ridge of
hills I mentiond by Maidstone; its a Greate height and
shows you a vast precipice down on the farther side, and
such a vast vale full of woods Enclosures and Little towns.
There is a very good river that runs by a Little town
Called Darken just at the foote of this hill, very famous for
good troutts and great store of ffish. On this hill the top is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Cover’d with box whence its name proceeds, and there is
other wood but its all Cutt in Long private walks very
shady and pleasant, and this is a great diversion to the Company
and would be more ffrequented if nearer Epsom town.</p>

<p class='c012'>About 4 miles off is S<sup>r</sup> Robert Howards house which I
went to see, its a Square building, the yards and offices
very Convenient about it, and severall Gardens walled in.
All the windows are sashes and Large squares of glass; I
observ’d they are double sashes to make y<sup>e</sup> house the
warmer, for it Stands pretty bleake. Its a brick building.
You Enter a hall which opens to the Garden, thence to
two parlours, drawing-roomes and good staires, there are
abundance of Pictures, above is a Dineing roome and
drawing roome with very good tapistry-hangings of Long
standing. There is severall bed Chambers well ffurnish’d,
good damaske beds and hangings and window Curtaines of
the same, and so neatly kept ffolded up in Clean sheets
pinn’d about the beds and hangings. There are severall
other good beds and ffurniture, one roome all y<sup>e</sup> bed and
hangings are of a fine damaske made of worsted, it Lookes
pretty and with a Gloss Like Camlett, of a Light Ash Coullour.
There are good pictures of the family, S<sup>r</sup> Robert’s Son and
Lady, which was a Daughter of the Newport house, with
her Children in a very Large Picture. There is fine adornements
of Glass on the Chimney and fine marble Chimney
pieces, some Closets with Inlaid floores, its all very neate
and fine with the several Courts at the Entrance—this I
thinke was all remarkable at Epsome which is 14 mile to
London.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another Journey to Broughton in Oxfordshire, my
brother’s, and now my nephew’s house, the Lord Say and
Seale. I went by Hartfordshire and Bedford from London
to Wane 20 mile, thence to Hitching 14 miles, most in
Lanes and deep Land, and in the winter bad Roads, but
very good Land—good Corn—the wheate Look’d well
but Grass and Summer Corn wanted rain, being a drye
Spring. Thence to Bedford town 12 mile more, these miles
are Longer than those about London and much in Lanes
and woods.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span> Bedford town is an old Building, its wash’d by the river
Ouse which Comes from Buckingham and is here Broader
than in most places till it reaches Yorke; its stored with
very good ffish and those which have Gardens on its brinke
keepes sort of trunck or what they Call them. Its a
Receptacle of wood of a pretty size full of holes to Let the
water in and out, here they keep the ffish they Catch as
pike, perch, tench &amp;c, so they have it readye for their use,
this is of mighty advantage Especially for the Publick
houses—you see the ffish taken out ffresh for supper or
dinner. The river runns twineing about and runns into
severall notches of Ground w<sup>ch</sup> is sett full of willows, and
many Little boates Chained to the sides belonging to y<sup>e</sup>
people of the town for their diversion. It runns by a
Ground which is made into a fine bowling-green, its upon a
hill and a pretty ascent from the river that is besett with
willows all round beneath; y<sup>e</sup> bowling green is well kept
with Seates and summer houses in it for the use of the
town and Country Gentlemen of which many resort to
it Especially the market dayes. At the Entrance of the
town you pass over y<sup>e</sup> river on a bridge which has a gate
on it and some houses—this river beares barges. These
truncks or Baskets which keepes the ffish are ffastned by
Chaines to the sides of the Banks in each mans Garden.
There is nothing worth notice in the town, severall streetes
small and old, the middle streete which runns from y<sup>e</sup>
Bridge is pretty broad, wherein stands y<sup>e</sup> market place and
house which is on severall stone pillars and raill’d in.
There is above it roomes which were design’d for the
session and publick Buissness of the town by the Lord
Russell that built it, but his untimely death, being beheaded,
put a stop to its ffinishing. They now put it to noe use
but spinning haveing begun to set up the woollen worke,
but its Just in its Infancy. Over this is the top which is
flatt rooff’d Leaded and railed in, from thence you see the
whole town and Country round.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a pretty many Gentry about y<sup>e</sup> Country neare
neighbours, and many Live in the town tho’ in such old
houses. From thence I went to Asply 8 mile where the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Earth turns wood into stone and had a piece of it; it
seemes its only one sort of wood the Aldertree which turns
so, and Lay or drive a paile or Stake into the ground there
in seven yeares its petrify’d into stone, from thence to
Onborn w<sup>ch</sup> is 3 mile more.</p>

<p class='c012'>Here is the Duke of Bedfords house which I had seen
before with the fine Gardens and parke, so proceeded on
to Dunstable 9 miles ffarther where I staid and dined with
my kinswoman my aunt Woolsley’s Daughter marry’d to
a D<sup>r</sup> of physick D<sup>r</sup> Marsh, and from thence I went to
Laighton Buserd and thence to Whinslow about 12 mile—this
is in Buckinghamshire—thence to Broughton in
Oxfordshire 17 mile, and staid a weeke and then returned
through oxfford Citty 18 mile, and so to London 48 mile
more.</p>
<h3 class='c026'><i>A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF EPSOME HAMPTON COURT AND WINDSOR</i></h3>

<p class='c030'>Epsom is 15 miles from London, there are great curiosityes
in cut hedges and trees almost before all doores.
They have trees in rows which they cut up smooth and
about 3 or 4 yards up, they Lay frames of wood in manner
of a pent house, so plat the branches on it and cuts it
smooth, they leave the stem of the tree to run up and then
cut it clear to the top w<sup>ch</sup> they cut in round heads. There
are severall good houses in or about Epsham—S<sup>r</sup> Rob<sup>t</sup>
Howard’s w<sup>ch</sup> I have described, M<sup>r</sup> Wessell’s now M<sup>r</sup>
Scawen’s. There is Lord Baltimores in Woodcut Green
Encompass’d w<sup>th</sup> a wall at the Entrance—a breast wall
with pallisadoes. Large courts one within the other and a
back way to y<sup>e</sup> stables where is a pretty horse pond. The
house is old but Low, tho’ Large,—run over much ground.
In ffront 6 windows and in the top just in the middle 12
Chimneys in a row, being 3 and 3 below Joyning back to
back and 3 and 3 above; the others Looke into a Court w<sup>ch</sup>
is built round. As I drove by the side saw broad Chimneys
on the End, and at due distance on the side on both Ends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>y<sup>e</sup> sides of a Court, w<sup>ch</sup> is terminated in a building on w<sup>ch</sup>
is a Lead w<sup>th</sup> railes and Barristers.</p>

<p class='c012'>That house which is now Lord Guilfords at another side
of Epsham, Lookes nobly in a fine parke pailed round.
Severall rows of trees in the front of all sorts—Lofty, and
some cut Piramidy, some suger-Loafe or rather Like a
mushrom-top. The front has 6 Large windows and the
doore w<sup>ch</sup> is glass, as many on the next story. You Enter
by a Large Court w<sup>ch</sup> is on y<sup>e</sup> Left side—Stable court; to
the right into y<sup>e</sup> Gardens, fore right you Enter a broad
tarass railed in and Paved with stone, you enter a noble
Lofty hall, plaine but neate, painted white. On y<sup>e</sup> right is
a Little parlour, the lesser hall hung w<sup>th</sup> armes, a butler’s
office, with bedchambers and Closets, thence goes y<sup>e</sup> Kitchen,
schullery, bakeing room and Laundry into a Court of all y<sup>e</sup>
offices and the stable yard. Out of y<sup>e</sup> Little parlour goes
into a pretty Chappel which has a balcony closet looking
into it for the Lord and Lady.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Left hand of y<sup>e</sup> hall Led into a great parlour w<sup>ch</sup>
runnes to the End of the house, and makes the ffront, and
short again into another great parlour or dineing roome
which makes y<sup>e</sup> End ffront of the house; this also opens into
y<sup>e</sup> staircase, it Leads on to a drawing roome, Closet, bed
Chamber, two dressing roomes, w<sup>ch</sup> with y<sup>e</sup> great staircase
makes up y<sup>e</sup> ffront backward and the other End ffront, w<sup>ch</sup>
Lookes into y<sup>e</sup> stable yard and a garden railed in w<sup>th</sup> a
Large pond or Cannall. The back ffront goes out into a
garden or Court w<sup>th</sup> Gravel walks round, and a Crosse w<sup>ch</sup>
cuts it into 4 grassplotts where are Brass statues, and Leads
out through fine jron Carved gates as at the ffront out into
y<sup>e</sup> highway. The right End ffront of y<sup>e</sup> house is into y<sup>e</sup>
Garden. Out of both of y<sup>e</sup> great parlours and drawing
roome two Entrances at an Equal distance upon gravell
walks. This garden is gravell’d round. Y<sup>e</sup> two middle
walks run up to a double mount which cast the garden into
3 Long grass walks w<sup>ch</sup> also are very broad, w<sup>th</sup> 3 flower
potts. There are two degrees of stepps to Each of these
Gravell walks, the first lands on a Gravell that turns in a
3 side square w<sup>ch</sup> shapes y<sup>e</sup> upper mount. The Long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>gravell walke to y<sup>e</sup> right hand runns aCrosse the mount to
a thicket that Enters y<sup>e</sup> Grove and is Lost. The other to
the Left runns up the whole Length of y<sup>e</sup> grove up to white
gates and open views into y<sup>e</sup> parke. The two Ends of the
Little square gravel walke round the first mount terminates
on the right in same thicket or Grove, and has only for
show a Carved frame as a gate, w<sup>th</sup> wood carv’d Like Cage
work painted white, with an arch Entrance in the middle
for form sake, to make it Look uniforme to the Like on y<sup>e</sup>
Left, w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to a walk as Long as the Gravell up to the
wall, and is directly arbour. Like high trees, Cut up to the
top and with heads which close in an arch—in the middle
is Long white seates. There are two or three Lesser walks
w<sup>ch</sup> run across it to y<sup>e</sup> right into the Grove and Lost in
the maze; to the Left to another Long walk w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to a
Grotto and runs parralel w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> gravel walke to the top.
You Enter a space paved and open arch’d round in seates
like a Court, and thence you Enter the Grotto, an arch
Entirely dark but at the Entrance it is so Large as 6 arched
seates, and between carv’d stone very fine of all sorts of
flowers, ffigures, ffruites; y<sup>e</sup> Pillars or Peers pretty broad.
this ran up to a sumerhouse at the End, w<sup>ch</sup> is grown over
with greens cut smooth—windows all round. Below this is
a broad green walke w<sup>ch</sup> begins at the first Garden and so
continues round w<sup>th</sup> y<sup>e</sup> wall quite to that broad Gravel walke,
and is continued by y<sup>e</sup> wall quite Encompassing y<sup>e</sup> maze,
in w<sup>ch</sup> are some slaunt cut wayes, and it terminates in the
other side of the first Garden just by a garden railed in in
which is a Large pond, square in nature of a cannall, the
bank green Cut fine, and borders for flowers and greens,
and a Breast wall to the first Garden, on w<sup>ch</sup> are flower
potts. On the upper mount—all the grass and bank Even
cut—Stands 4 flower potts painted blew—Some red on y<sup>e</sup> 3
divisions—y<sup>e</sup> gravell Cut out as on the Margin.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom the Hall you go to y<sup>e</sup> staircase, there is also a
doore out of the second parlour. This is noble and Lofty
all plain wanscoate, only y<sup>e</sup> halfe paces inlaid. The first
is a window the whole height, 13 Large pannells in Length,
5 in breadth, which Lookes into one of the Courts where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>the pond is and stable yard. The next half pace Leads you
on y<sup>e</sup> Left hand to the private appartment that is not so
Lofty, over y<sup>e</sup> Least hall to an anty roome, thence a dineing
roome, soe drawing roome 5 bed Chambers and Closetts.
The Last Closett goes into a balcony w<sup>ch</sup> runs aCross y<sup>e</sup>
middle of said Lofty window, and Looks into the staircase.
Out of y<sup>e</sup> Eating or dineing roome goes a Closett for y<sup>e</sup>
Ladyes into y<sup>e</sup> Chappell w<sup>th</sup> very good back staires up to
y<sup>e</sup> top roomes. Y<sup>e</sup> great staires continues up to the Gallery
and turns in a long halfe pace, w<sup>ch</sup> Enters it at two doores
in Equal distances. Its a Lofty, Large as well as Long
roome, noe painting or frettwork. At Each End are
severall handsome bedChambers and Closetts but none
ffurnish’d, but y<sup>e</sup> private appartments has pladd Chamlet
damaske neatly made up, not new, Glass sconces, and over
the Chimney, looking glasses in frames. The parke is fine
but not stock’d, w<sup>ch</sup> when it is and house ffurnish’d will be a
noble seate.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is another house of M<sup>r</sup> Ruths who married Lady
Dennagall is new and neate. The Entrance is a space the
breadth of y<sup>e</sup> Court and ffront, rail’d in and opening in y<sup>e</sup>
middle w<sup>th</sup> sort of wicket, two such at Each End w<sup>th</sup> heavye
Latches to pull up, and the gate swings both wayes. There
is a brick wall w<sup>th</sup> peers and breast high, and jron pallisadoes
of a good breadth Each side the gate, w<sup>ch</sup> is Carv’d
jron work w<sup>th</sup> a Deer on the top of a Cypher, and an oaken

potts, those on y<sup>e</sup> Peeres Each side y<sup>e</sup> jron works Lesser
flower potts. Beyond are the gates into the coach yard,
w<sup>ch</sup> with the Stables is a neate Pile of Buildings by it self.
Just on y<sup>e</sup> other side is such a building the kitchen and
offices and little Laundry Court, and here is the back
Entrance through a Long brick Entry open on one side,
but a wall to y<sup>e</sup> Court side and house, and Enters into a
passage that Leads to a little hall brick’t, w<sup>th</sup> roomes
for y<sup>e</sup> buttler and a batheing roome. By it is a Large
hall paved w<sup>th</sup> stone and thence is one way into the
garden. Under the staires and balcony that descends
from y<sup>e</sup> dineing roome in y<sup>e</sup> first passage are staires w<sup>ch</sup>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>brings to a space that turns up to the Great staires and
roomes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The ffront Entrance is into a handsome Court, one Large
paved walke in the middle between Grass, the borders
round of flowers, y<sup>e</sup> wall w<sup>th</sup> trees. You ascend some stepps
to a broad terrass paved and with a breast wall sett w<sup>th</sup>
flower potts. This is the breadth of the house and at Each
End two Large white seates w<sup>th</sup> arches over y<sup>e</sup> head. You
Enter a step or two to this space w<sup>ch</sup> Leads to y<sup>e</sup> staires on
y<sup>e</sup> Left to a little parlour wanscoted, white in veines and
gold mouldings, a neat Booffett ffurnish’d with Glasses and

roome, beyond that a Closet that comes out into a
little passage to the staircase, w<sup>ch</sup> is Large and makes
the fourth part of the house; they are wanscoate varnish’d
and the Lower step or two Larger, and y<sup>e</sup> other End is
in a turn. The half paces are strip’d, the wood put w<sup>th</sup>
y<sup>e</sup> Graine, the next slip against the Graine, w<sup>ch</sup> makes
it Looke pretty as if Inlaid.</p>

<p class='c012'>You Enter one roome hung with Crosstitch in silks, the

a little Gravel in an oval or round, where is a Large
fountain of stone full of stone Images to spout the water.
This Garden is the breadth of the dwelleing house—the

with gates Leading to another Garden of grass Cut in
shapes and knotts, w<sup>th</sup> flowers and all sorts of greens cut in
shapes, w<sup>th</sup> paths of Gravel to fform them. On the Left
side a Coddling hedge secured a walke of orange and
Lemmon trees in perfection. This is Closed with a green
house all the breadth of the garden, through w<sup>ch</sup> you Enter
another of fflowers; thence into orchard and kitchen garden
w<sup>ch</sup> is Cast in Exact forms to Look neate. In the green
Garden was Large alloes plants and all sorts of Perpetualls
as well as annualls.</p>

<p class='c012'>There are abundance of houses built of brick, with fine
gardens and Courts, w<sup>th</sup> open gates and railes to view, w<sup>ch</sup>
are used as Lodgings for the Company; and now the wells
are built about, and a Large Light roome to walk in
brick’d, and a pump put on the well. A Coffee house and
two roomes for gameing, and shops for sweetmeates and
fruite. Monday morning is their day, the Company meete
and then they have some Little diversion, as raceing of
boys or Rabbets or Piggs. In the Evening the company
meete in the Greenes, first in the upper Green many steps
up, where are Gentlemen Bowling, Ladyes walking. There
are Little Shopps and a gameing or danceing roome, the
same man at the wells keepes it, sells Coffee there also.
The Lower green is not farr off—just in the heart of the
town: its a much neater green and warmer. The whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>side of this is a very Large roome w<sup>th</sup> Large sashe windows
to the green, w<sup>th</sup> Cusheons in the windows and seates all
along. There are two hazard boards; at the End is a
Milliner and China Shop, this is belonging to the Great
tavern or Eateing house, and all the Length of this roome
to the street ward is a Piaza wall, and a row of trees Cutt
and platted together as the ffashion of the place, w<sup>th</sup> tops
running up a top with heads. The Crosse in the Streete
has a Good Clock.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the hill where is the race posts they have made a
ring as in Hide Parke, and they Come in Coaches and
drive round, but it is only Lords day nights and some
nights. There has been 40 Coaches and six which are the
Gentlemen in the County round, and 20 and 2 horses.
The Company in y<sup>e</sup> town Epshum shall be Clutter’d w<sup>th</sup>
Company from Satturday to Tuesday and then they many
times goe, being so neare London, so come againe on more
Satturdays.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom Epsham I went to Banstead where the parson of
the Parish has diverted himself in his garden these fifty
yeares, is now old and doates, but has Curious hedges, one
Garden w<sup>th</sup> Grass plotts and Earth walks Cut and wedd.
His grass plotts has stones of divers fformes and sizes
which he names Gods and Goddesses; and hedges and
arbours of thorn soe neately Cut, and in all ffigures in great
rounds. One is a Large arbour: You Enter a straite
passage as unto a Cell, but within a roome, round y<sup>t</sup> by a
narrow Entry you Come to a Large Square with trees and
seates, all quick sett hedges cut fine. One is a tree w<sup>ch</sup> the
ivy has Covered and there are staires up directly upright,
and on y<sup>e</sup> top is an Eight square Bench—round, the Green
grows up Close about it cut even, this he Calls “Tenneriff”
being in that fform. Next it is another tree, there is a
fflatt and on it is a table or stoole on w<sup>ch</sup> is a Great white
stone in form of some statue that apole w<sup>th</sup> 9 stones round
less the muses—this is Parnassus. There are severall
heads painted w<sup>ch</sup> are named Mogul Grand Seignior, Cham
of Tartary, Zarr of Muscovy, placed in severall places.
Another Garden is Grass plotts w<sup>th</sup> yews and holly Lawrells,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>round this on the bank is sett stones very thick, some very
much bigger for officers, this is the whole Confederate
army and their Generalls. Here is a trumpeter, Hercules
and Bacchus and a hedge of Lawrell 7 foote broad. Here
are also two trees Cover’d with Ivy and thorne Cut smooth
and made in ffashion of two great pillars for Hercules
pillars. There is in y<sup>e</sup> middle some platted together and
makes a Cover to a seate below, and there is a Rose Cut
out—you may talk as under the Rose. In his house he
has many Curiosetyes of stones, one like a brick of bread,
another Like a shoulder of mutton, a piece of wood from
an old tree as Like a mounteer capp w<sup>th</sup> a button on the
top, another like a furbellow’d peticoat, another stone like
an apple paired and a piece Cut out and grown Deadish—its
said this is Petrify’d into stone as the moss in Knarsborough
and the wood at Apsley in Bedfordshire; here
were many Shells, Birds, jndian shoes, bootes, purses &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c012'>Ffrom Epsham to Leatherhead 3 mile, we pass by S<sup>r</sup>
Robert Howards which I have described. Here is a little
town where they make much Leather, and other little
trades, many Butchers which supply Epsham. Here it is
that the water which sinks away at Swallow hole at Mole
under Box Hill which is 7 mile off, and here it Bubbles up
in twenty places from a hill, and Compases a great river
half a mile off, over which a long bridge of 14 great arches
of stone by their Height shews sometimes the water to be
very deep. A little farther its so deep as cannot be fforded,
here the Channell is not so broad, only four Large Arches.
We goe over thence a mile and halfe to M<sup>r</sup> Moores ffine
house on a hill, its built w<sup>th</sup> brick and stone Coyned, and
the windows Stone, nine sashes to the Garden; the jutting
out in the middle is three windows. The top is in a peak
painted frisco, and a Cornish round on Each side; a low
building Each End Like Wings w<sup>th</sup> same Cornish Leaded
and flower potts on it, w<sup>ch</sup> are the offices on one Side, and
Lead to a summer House and backward to the private
Entrance, a Court y<sup>t</sup> you ascend by steps of stone and jron
barristers with turnings and halfe paces to the part of y<sup>e</sup>
house in Constant use. The ffront in the Entrance is as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the Garden, only here are but Eight windows, only two in
the middle jutting the top, and that here you see not those
two Low wings. You Enter by the Church yard, noe
great Court or roome for it, a very Little court w<sup>ch</sup> on the
right hand Leads into y<sup>e</sup> garden on a banck green walke,
to a seate or summer house finely painted and stands on
four pillars. Within this Leads into a gravel walk w<sup>ch</sup> goes
round y<sup>e</sup> first Garden. The summer house you might pass
through to the same green banck walk, which Leads to a
broad Grass walk on the right hand up the hill near a
quarter of a mile, Each side planted w<sup>th</sup> trees, and y<sup>e</sup>
ground some for kitchen gardens orchards hott beds. The
top of the hill has two white seates and a summer house,
this has white open gates, Large as the walk. Here is a
very fine pond runs across the breadth of the gardens and
orchards. The Garden at the house is all flatt, much in
Grass walks and bancks sett w<sup>th</sup> green, most yews. There
is a great gravel walk to the fountain from the middle of
the house, w<sup>ch</sup> is filled by a Long Cannall as broad as the
walk; at the farther End is a trion gilt, with a horn w<sup>ch</sup>
can blow the water 20 yards. Here are seates on the
bancks, and y<sup>e</sup> ground is set much in Grass walks w<sup>th</sup>
dwarfe greens, which Cutts the grass plotts into four, which
are Cutt into fflower deluces and Severall Devices w<sup>th</sup>
paths of Gravell, borders of mould, in which are greens of
all sorts, Piramids and then round jnterchangeable. Beyond
this is another space as Large, w<sup>th</sup> a round space w<sup>th</sup> a
Large stone ffigure, and severall Less ffigures of brass in
the little squares and strapps of grass, w<sup>ch</sup> was fform’d by
Cross and round gravell walks. There is two broad Gravell
walks runns aslaunt like two wings from the first garden,
as it were parrallel w<sup>th</sup> the Cannall, and these terminate in
a wood w<sup>ch</sup> has a Glide through trees Cut aslant, agreable
to the walks to give the view quite to Hampton town.</p>

<hr class='c029' />

<p class='c012'>Thence to Hampton Court by Kingston 6 mile, all by the
park, the palace Enters just by the Thames. On the gate
is Lyon, Unicorn and fflower potts, the Starre and garter
and Draggon y<sup>e</sup> thistle and rose Carv’d. Here is a space
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>where the Stables on one side and houses for suttlers for to
provide for the servants. The front is in a Demy Circle—At
the gates four towers of Brick. Beyond the half moone are
two straite buildings in w<sup>ch</sup> are gates, at the Ends two such
brick towers, soe you Enter through those four towers.
The guard Court on the Left goes to y<sup>e</sup> old Buildings. On
the Right you enter a long paved Entry; on one side are
Lodgings, at the End are Cloysters round a Court which has
a Large ffountaine in Grass, and at Each Corner a painted
post for balls or Statues. The grass is planted round with
Lawrell and yew, ffilleroy and Cyprus, cut a round head, and
a Piramid. The Cloysters Lead to the royal Staircase which
is very Lofty and spacious w<sup>th</sup> arches for seates, the steps
jron railes Carv’d and gilt, the wall black and gold painted
w<sup>th</sup> armory like a wanscoate. Over that is Curious paintings,
the twelve Cæsars, over that the banquet of the Gods, all at
Length, with Ceres over y<sup>e</sup> side board w<sup>th</sup> plenty. The
rooffe is angells and Cherubims, the ffront on the halfe pace
is Julian and the spectre that appear’d to him, in a tent of
green, the Curtain drawn soe bold as if real w<sup>th</sup> gold ffringe.
Here you Enter y<sup>e</sup> guard Chamber adorn’d with pikes,
Halberts, Biounetts Daggers and Pistolls and gunns, w<sup>th</sup>
Bandeleers or pouches for amunition, all set in workes and
ffigures about the Wanscoate, over y<sup>e</sup> Chimney Pistolls and
Daggers sett like the starre in the garter. Thence you go
into an anty room hung w<sup>th</sup> tapestry, thence into y<sup>e</sup> Common
audience roome where was a throne and Cannopy, crimson
Damaske with Gold ffringe; the form the same round the
roome. Here was King Charles y<sup>e</sup> firsts Picture on horseback
over the mantlepiece. All the rooffes of the roomes
are Curiosly painted w<sup>th</sup> different storyes. Out of this you
Enter the Grand state roome which has King Williams
Picture at Length on the Mantlepiece, ffine Pictures over all
doores and Carvings in wood. The throne and Cannopy
here was Scarlet velvet with Rich Gold orrice and window
Curtains. Thence into the dineing roome where hangs in
y<sup>e</sup> middle a Chrystall Branch for Candles. Its hung with
tapistry, I think its here the Queen of Bohemias Picture is
over the Chimney piece—Sophia’s mother. The window
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>Curtaines flower’d Crimson Damaske w<sup>th</sup> gold ffringe;
thence the drawing roome w<sup>ch</sup> has a Silver branch in the
middle, and sconces and Queen Marys Picture—here is
Crimson velvet. Out of this is the presence Chamber w<sup>th</sup> a
Low screen across the roome to keep company off the bed
w<sup>ch</sup> is scarlet velvet w<sup>th</sup> gold orrice and hung w<sup>th</sup> fine
tapistry. Out of y<sup>e</sup> bedchamber goes the dressing roome
hung w<sup>th</sup> yellow damaske and Chaires the same. Here was
the queen mother Dutchess of Yorks Picture over the
Chimney, here is a doore into the private Lodgings where
there is 2 bed Chambers, one Jndian Embroydery the other
a mixt damaske; and Closets and antyroomes to the
galleryes and backstaires.</p>

<p class='c012'>Out of the dressing roome is the Queens Closet, the
hangings, Chaires, Stooles and Screen the same, all of satten
stitch done in worsteads, beasts, birds, jmages and ffruites all
wrought very ffinely by Queen Mary and her maids of
honour.</p>

<p class='c012'>From thence into a Large Long gallery Wanscoated, and
pictures of all the Roman warrs on one side, the other side
was Large Lofty windows, two marble tables in two peers
w<sup>th</sup> two great open jarrs on Each side, Each table two such;
at the End the same for to put potts of orange and mirtle
trees in. The window Curtaines and couches or fformes all
green and white rich damaske.</p>

<p class='c012'>Out of this into a Long gallery, plain wanscoate without
any adornment, which is for people to waite in, Either of the
servants of the houshold or who waites in buissness of the
ordinary sort, and here are doores that Lead to the back
staires and to private Lodgings. This Leads at the End
into the part was design’d for the Kings side, into a noble
Gallery w<sup>th</sup> Curious Pictures of y<sup>e</sup> scriptures painted by the
Carthusion.</p>

<p class='c012'>The King of Ffrance offer’d 3000 pound apiece for them,
or indeed any money. Here are green and white Damaske
window Curtaines and Couches as the other was. This
Leads to roomes not ffinished in the same number as on the
queen’s side—one is begun to be painted on the top. The
sides of the walls are painted just Like pieces of tapestry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>here is Prince Georges picture at Length, w<sup>th</sup> his Dukall
Corronet, and an Anchor as High Admirall, and thus to
the other roomes, to y<sup>e</sup> guardroome and Royal Staircase as
on the Queens side, but none here ffinish’d. The Leads
gives a vast sight all about of the parke and gardens, the
ffront of the house to the garden has four Large stone
ffigures Hercules, jupiter, Mars, Neptune.</p>

<p class='c012'>There is a long Cannall runs from the ffront a great way,
and a Large ffounttaine next the house in the first garden,
w<sup>th</sup> a broad Gravell and a Cross. till I came almost to
Windsor—I drove by some of the fforest and the parke and
came in another way into town by y<sup>e</sup> Castle across K:
Charles’s Walk. jn the Castle yard is a Little box the queen
has bought of Lord Godolphin. The garden joyns to the
Duke of S<sup>t</sup> Albans for a little retreate out of y<sup>e</sup> Palace.
You Enter a Brick Court, on the Left is a Little Guard
roome, on y<sup>e</sup> Right a Row of roomes w<sup>th</sup> Chambers over
them for the Kitchen and Pastry and Butteryes, and a Little
garden pailed in. Then you go on, and on the Left hand
Enter the house into an Entry: on the Left is a little
parlour for y<sup>e</sup> Ladies of honour to dine in, beyond that
Back Staires Pantry and a Cistern or Place to Wash things
in; by that is the guard roome, under it the Cellars.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the Right hand is a Large Antyroome for persons to
wait, where are Marble tables in y<sup>e</sup> Peeres between the
windows; white damaske window curtaines and cane chaires.
Next it is the Dineing roome some stepps down, where was
red silk Curtaines Chaires and stooles, and Benches round
the roome all red silk, w<sup>th</sup> same coull<sup>d</sup> orrice Lace; here
was a white marble table behind the doore as a sideboard,
and a Clap table under y<sup>e</sup> Large Looking Glass between the
windows. Next this was a drawing roome; both these
roomes were hung w<sup>th</sup> small Jmage tapistry very Lively and
ffresh, here was Crimson Damaske window Curtaines, Chaires
and stooles. The next was what was Prince George’s
dressing roome, hung, and window Curtaines Chaires and
stooles, all w<sup>th</sup> yellow damaske, w<sup>th</sup> marble Chimney pieces
as all y<sup>e</sup> Roomes have of Differing Coull<sup>rs</sup> black white, grey,
rance &amp;c &amp;c. Large Looking-glasses; all the roomes in all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>y<sup>e</sup> house is plaine unvarnished oake Wanscoate which
Lookes very neate. W<sup>th</sup>in the dressing roome is a Closet
on one hand, the other side is a Closet y<sup>t</sup> Leads to a little
place w<sup>th</sup> a seate of Easement of Marble w<sup>th</sup> sluces of
water to wash all down. There is a back doore in y<sup>e</sup>
dressing roome, to a little anty roome with presses, a little
Wanscoate table for tea, cards or writeing, so to a back
staires;—the Queen’s appartment is over it. From y<sup>e</sup>
Greate Staire at the Entrance of the house Lands you in a
passage that Enters—the anty roome is Crimson damaske
curtains. Great chaire and Stooles and Benches; the same
next it. The presence roome here is ffigured Crimson
Velvet window Curtaines, Chaires and stooles; here is the
Q. A Wife to K. James the First at Length in her Rideing
habit, by her horse and three or four Couple of hounds—these
were hung w<sup>th</sup> ffine tapistry as the two below.</p>

<p class='c012'>Next this was the Queen’s bedChamber, hung, the bed,
window-curtaines the same, all Rich Crimson Damaske.
Here was the screen round the bed as the manner is to all
the Souveraignes beds. Over the Chimney was Prince
George’s Picture and by the side of the bed was the Duke
of Glocester’s in an oval. Thence into a Dressing-roome
hung with Divers Coull<sup>d</sup> flowered sattin, chaires and stooles
the same, ffine fflower’d muslin window curtaines, A fine
Little high screen burnt jappan of 4 Leaves, another
Chimney screen w<sup>th</sup> 4 Leaves of the stone work in ffigures—jndian.
Out of this was y<sup>e</sup> Queens Closet just over
Prince Georges but y<sup>t</sup> was Locked. The other side was a
little waiting roome to Just such marble seates of Easem<sup>t</sup>
w<sup>th</sup> the sluces of water as that below was in the Queens
bedChamber. Overright y<sup>e</sup> Entrance of the dressing-roome
was another Little Closet with the tea Equipage, and under
that was such a Little tea roome within y<sup>e</sup> drawingroome.
Here in the dressing roome was a backway to a little
waiting passage, with presses and such little wanscoate
tables; this Leads to the back staires where there is one
bedchamber. The Queen’s appartment ffronts the garden;
out of the drawing roome you come on a terrass of Gravell,
then descend stepps down a green banck to a large green
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>space that has 4 bench seates painted white; behind them
is a Green bank, and a Large space of green on Either end
fill’d with trees, Lawrell ffrilleroy, Cyprus, yews, heads a
Pirramids, and Mirtles. This is ffenced with jron palasadoes
painted, to another garden cut in squares and figures, with
all sorts of fflowers and greens, which has at y<sup>e</sup> End a Cut
hedge and Leads on to a sort of orchard with dwarfe trees.
These gardens and orchards is in Gravel Walks and Long
green walks, in variety as such a thing in miniature can
admitt.</p>

<p class='c012'>I drove through another part of Windsor to see a Race
run by two ffootemen—an English and Scotch—the fformer
a taller Bigger man than the other. The ground Measur’d
and Cut even in a round ring, was almost four mile; they
were to run it round so often as to make up 22 mile, which
was the distance between Chareing Cross and Windsor
Cross—that was five times quite round and so farre as made
up the odd miles and Measure. They ran a round in
25 minutes. I saw them run the first three rounds and halfe
another, in an hour and seventeen minutes, and they ffinished
it in two hours and a halfe. The English gain’d the second
round the start, and kept it at the same distance y<sup>e</sup> five
rounds, and then the Scotchman came up to him and got
before him to the post. The Englishman fell down within
a few yards of the post. Many hundred pounds were won
and lost about it, they ran both very neately, but my judgment
Gave it y<sup>e</sup> Scotchman because he seem’d to save himself
to y<sup>e</sup> Last Push.</p>

<p class='c012'>I drove home by a fine house of Lord Rawnelaughs, 14
windows in the ffront, a square building—much gardening
and Curious they say, but that Ladyes Pride is, none must
see them, and soe Drove a fine Gravell road cut with rows
of trees. In a mile you come to a broad open way to
Windsor on the Left hand, on the Right to a little house of
y<sup>e</sup> Duchess of Marlboroughs, which is very exact gardens
and ffountaines, Cut hedges and Groves, pail’d in; ffrom
this house is the ffine Gravell walke continued very broad
between high rows of trees—on one hand a ffine Grove of
straite trees.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span> This is three mile to Windsor all a Clear visto to the
Castle, to that which is K. Charle’s Walke for Shooting,
which you Enter by a Broad Pallasadoe-ffences the whole
breadth of the road. So at y<sup>e</sup> other End which is a mile
and goes out into the road w<sup>ch</sup> comes ffrom Hampton
Court which you Cross into the yards and Courts that lead
up into the Castle.</p>
